AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> exhaustion of the first edition
of this book, within so short a time of its publication, makes it
difficult to add much new matter for the reissue now called for, or, in
the light of subsequent research and experience, to revise what had
already been written.</p>

<p>Any book that seemed to show a way of meeting the present building
difficulties, however partially, was fairly assured of a welcome, but
the somewhat unforeseen demand for my small contribution to the great
volume of literature on cottage-building is, I&nbsp;think, to be
attributed chiefly to its description of Pisé-building.</p>

<p>Of the very large number of letters that reach me from readers of the
book, quite ninety-nine out of every hundred are concerned with
Pisé.</p>

<p>The other methods of building have their advocates and exponents, but
it is clearly Pisé that has caught the attention of the public as well
as of the Press both at home and abroad, and it is to this method of
construction that I have chiefly devoted my attention since the writing
of the book as it first appeared.</p>

<p>In our English climate Pisé-building is a summer craft, and the
small-scale experiments of one person through a single summer cannot in
the nature of things add very greatly to the sum of our knowledge of
what is possible with Pisé and of what is not.</p>

<p>Most of the new data have come through the building of Mr. Strachey’s
demonstration house, an account of which is included in the present
volume.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, various tests are being carried out with the
help of the National Physical Laboratory; but the results, though
exceedingly encouraging, are not yet ready for publication.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a></p>

<p>The fact that Pisé-building is essentially a “Dry-earth method” makes
necessary the creation of artificial summer conditions under which the
experiments may be conducted
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page6" id = "page6"> </a>
during the past winter. As a result of these researches,
a&nbsp;considerable mass of useful data has become available for the
opening of the present building season.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id
= "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a></p>

<p>Much helpful information is also likely to come to us from the
Colonies, particularly from Rhodesia and British East Africa, where
there is great activity in Pisé-building, and where there is no “close
season” such as our winter imposes upon us here.</p>

<p>It is instructive also to note that great interest in Pisé-building
has been aroused in Canada and in Scandinavia, the two countries that we
were wont to associate particularly with timber-building.</p>

<p>From both I have received a number of letters complaining of “the
lumber shortage,” and discussing the advantages of Pisé as compared with
their traditional wood-construction.</p>

<p>If these great timber countries are themselves feeling the pinch, the
advocates of wooden houses for England may find that they are not merely
barking up the wrong tree, but up a tree that is not even there.</p>

<p>The timber famine is, in any case, a calamity to anyone dependent on
building, that is to everyone, for even a Pisé house must still have a
roof and floors and joinery.</p>

<p>But to invoke the timber house as our salvation under existing
conditions seems to be singularly perverse and unhelpful. Pisé, at all
events, seems to offer us a more promising field for exploration than
most of the other heterodox methods of construction that have been
suggested, too often upon credentials that will not bear any but the
most cursory scrutiny.</p>

<p>Pisé, even now, is still in its experimental infancy.</p>

<p>It has yet to prove itself in the fields of National Housing and of
competitive commercial building schemes on a large scale.</p>

<p>Lastly, Pisé does not claim to solve the housing problem. There is no
solution unless, by some miracle, the present purchasing power of the
sovereign appreciates by 200 per cent.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> country is faced by a dilemma
probably greater and more poignant than any with which it has hitherto
had to deal. It needs, and needs at once, a&nbsp;million new houses, and
it has not only utterly inadequate stores of material with which to
build them, but has not even the plant by which that material can be
rapidly created. There is not merely a shortage, but an actual famine
everywhere as regards the things out of which houses are made. Bricks
are wanted by the ten thousand million, but there are practically no
bricks in sight. All that the brickyards of the United Kingdom can do,
working all day and every day, is to turn out something like four
thousand million a year. But to those who want houses at once, what is
the use of a promise of bricks in five years’ time? To tell them to turn
to the stone quarries is a mere derision. Let alone the cost of work and
of transport, it is only in a few favoured places that the rocks will
give us what we want. Needless to say we are short, too, of lime and
cement, and probably shall be shorter. <i>No coal, no quicklime</i>, and
<i>No coal, no cement</i>, and as things look now, it is going to be a
case, if not of no coal, at any rate of much less coal. Even worse is
the shortage in timber&mdash;the material hitherto deemed essential for
the making of roofs, doors, windows and floors. Raw timber is hardly
obtainable, and seasoned timber does not exist. The same story has to be
told about tiles, slates, corrugated iron, and every other form of
“legitimate” roofing substance. There are none to be had.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
<p>In this dread predicament what are we to do as a nation? What we must
not do is at any rate quite clear. We must not lie down in the high road
of civilisation and cry out that we are ruined or betrayed, or that the
world is too hard for us, and that we must give up the task of living in
houses. Whether we like it or not we have got to do something about the
housing question, and we have got to do it at once, and there is an end.
Translated into terms of action, this means that as we have not got
enough of the old forms of material we must turn to others and learn how
to house ourselves with materials such as we have not used before. Once
again necessity must be the mother of invention, or rather, of invention
and revival, for in anything so old and universal as the housing problem
it is too late to be ambitious. Here we always find that there has been
an ancient Assyrian or Egyptian or a primitive man in front
of&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>It is the object of the present book to attack part of the problem of
how to build without bricks, and indeed without mortar, and equally
important, as far as possible without the vast cost of transporting the
heavy material of the house from one quarter of England to another. That
is my apology for introducing to the public a work dealing with what I
can hear old-fashioned master-builders describing as the “bastard” forms
of construction. One of these is Pisé de terre, the old system of
building with walls formed of rammed or compressed earth: a&nbsp;system
which was once known throughout Europe and of which the primitive
tribesmen of Arizona and New Mexico knew the secret. Down to our own day
it has been practised with wonderful success in the Valley of the Rhône.
Then come our own cob, once the cottage material <i>par excellence</i>
of Devonshire and the West of England, our system of building with plain
clay blocks, a&nbsp;plan indigenous in the Eastern counties, and again
the use of chalk and chalk pisé.</p>

The Search for Cheap Material</span></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Pisé de Terre</span></p>

<p>For me Pisé de terre, ever since I heard of it, has offered special
attractions. It, and it alone provides, or if one must be cautious,
appears to provide the way to turn an old dream of mine and of many
other people into a reality. My connection with the problem of housing,
and especially of rural housing, <i>i.e.</i> cottage housing, now nearly
a quarter of a century old, has been on the side of cheap material.
Rightly or wrongly (I&nbsp;know that many great experts in building
matters think quite wrongly), I&nbsp;have had the simplicity to believe
that if you are to get cheap housing you must get it by the use of cheap
material. It has always seemed to me that there is no other way. What
more natural than first to ask why building material was so dear, and
then what was the cause of its dearness? I&nbsp;found it in the fact
that bricks are very expensive things to make, that stones are very
expensive things to quarry, that cements are very expensive things to
manufacture, and worst of all, that all these things are very heavy and
very expensive to drag about the country, and to “dump” on the site in
some lonely situation where cottages or a small-holder’s house and
outbuildings are, to use the conventional phrase, “urgently demanded.”
Therefore, to the unfeigned amusement, nay, contempt of all my
architectural friends, I&nbsp;spent a great deal of my leisure in the
years before the war in racking my brains in the search for cheap
material. My deep desire was to find something in the earth out of which
walls could be made. My ideal was a man or group of men with spades and
pickaxes coming upon the land and creating the walls of a house out of
what they found there. I&nbsp;wanted my house, my cottage in
“Cloud-Cuckoo Land,” to rise like the lark from the furrows. But I was
at once dissuaded from my purpose by cautious and scientific persons.
The chemists, if they did not scoff like the architects, were visibly
perturbed.
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
“Your dream is impossible,” they said. “Nature abhors it as much as she
used to be supposed to abhor a vacuum. If your soil is clay, and you can
afford the time and cost of erecting kilns, and bringing coal to the
spot to make the bricks, you can no doubt turn the earth on the spot
into a house, but even then you had far better buy them of those that
sell. Your dream of having some chemical which will mix with the earth
and turn it into a kind of stone, is the merest delusion. It is the
nature of the earth to kill anything in the way of cement that is mixed
with it. For example, even a little earth will kill concrete or mortar.
Unless you wash your sand most carefully, and free it from all earth
stain, you will ruin your concrete blocks.” I&nbsp;appeared to be
literally “up against” a&nbsp;brick wall. It was that or nothing. And
then, and when things seemed at their very worst, a&nbsp;kind
correspondent of <i>The Spectator</i> showed me a way of escape.
I&nbsp;felt like a man lost in underground passages who suddenly sees a
tiny square of light and knows that it means the way out. Somebody
wrote, from South Africa I think, asking why I didn’t find the thing I
wanted in Pisé de terre, much used in Australia, and occasionally in
Cape Colony. Then came a rush of enlightenment. People who had seen and
even lived in such houses wrote to <i>The Spectator</i>, and the world
indeed for the moment seemed alive with Pisé de terre. I&nbsp;was even
lent the “Farmer’s Handbook” of New South Wales, in which the State
Government provides settlers with an elaborate description of how to
build in Pisé, and how to make the necessary shuttering for doing so. It
was then, too, that I began to hear of the seventeenth and
eighteenth-century buildings of Pisé in the Rhone Valley. In fact,
everybody but I seemed to know all there was to be known about Pisé de
terre. For the moment indeed, the situation seemed like that described
in <i>Punch’s</i> famous picture of the young lady and the German
professor. “<i>What is Volapuk?</i>” asks the young
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15" id = "page15"> </a>
lady. “<i>Ze universal language</i>,” says the professor. “<i>Where is
it spoken?</i>” “<i>No vairs.</i>” Pisé de terre appeared to be the
universal system of building, but as far as I could make out, it was
practised “no vairs,” or at any rate not in Europe.</p>

Experiments with “Pisé”</span></p>

<h5><a name = "introII" id = "introII">II</a></h5>

<p>I had got as far as the position described above, when down swept the
war upon Europe, and everything had to be postponed in favour of the
immediate need of filling the ranks of the nation’s army and teaching
the men how to fight our enemies. As the war went on, however, the
demand for rapid, cheap, and temporary building became very great, and I
felt I should be justified in trying some experiments with Pisé de
terre, even in spite of the difficulty of obtaining labour.</p>

<p>I think I can best illustrate the nature of Pisé and what it can do,
and I believe will do, if I shortly recount in chronological order these
humble pioneer efforts.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1915 I found that it was necessary in the interests
of the hospital established in my house to find a place in which to
store apples, for the men in blue consumed them in incredible
quantities. I&nbsp;thought I would try Pisé. Accordingly, I&nbsp;had
some shuttering made on the Australian model&mdash;not splendid
scientific shuttering such as is described in the body of this work, but
still shuttering quite sufficient for the purpose. With great rapidity a
little fruit-house was put up, roofed with boards, and covered with
blocks of compressed peat in order to make a roof which would be both
vermin-proof and also keep out the heat and the frost. In my ignorance
and my hurry, I&nbsp;now find that I violated every sound rule of Pisé
construction. I&nbsp;built the walls during a week of rain, when the
earth was wet, which was a great mistake; and I did not clear out the
stones, which was another error that prevented the walls from being
homogeneous. Worst
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
of all, as soon as the walls were built (and very pretty walls they
were, looking something like soft brown marble), I&nbsp;painted them
over with tar, which of course would not enter the wet wall, but only
made a skin, which in a few months peeled off exactly like the bark off
a plane tree. Yet in spite of this ignorant mishandling of my material,
the little fruit-house is still standing and sheltered till January the
few apples Nature allowed us to gather last autumn. It looks
disreputable, but there has been no structural collapse, nor will
there&nbsp;be.</p>

Rammed Chalk, “Pisé de Craie”</span></p>

<p>No sooner was the fruit-house finished than I was met by the demand
of my wife, the commandant of the hospital, to add to my house a
patients’ dining-room, which would be bright, dry, airy, warm, and
comfortable, and be large enough for forty men to have their meals in,
and to use as a sitting-room during the rest of the day. The local
builder said that it was impossible to make a wooden addition, for there
was no wood to be procured, or to build in bricks, since my house stands
600 ft. above the sea on an isolated chalk down. Crœsus would have found
it difficult at that time to build on my site, and for the ordinary
economic man&mdash;“L’homme à quarantes écus”&mdash;it was quite
impossible. But the room had got to be built, for the men were there,
and built at once, since the out-of-door life of July and August could
not continue. There was nothing to do but to fall back upon Pisé.
I&nbsp;decided to be ambitious and to experiment, not merely in Pisé de
terre, but in what I then thought&mdash;and perhaps rightly&mdash;was a
new form of Pisé, <i>i.e.</i> Pisé de craie or compressed chalk. My
shuttering therefore was put up. A&nbsp;hole not very far off was dug in
the earth, the chalk which was almost at the surface was quarried out,
and we began to build the wall, candid and contemptuous friends telling
us of course that the chalk wall would never stand the frosts in so
exposed a position, and that the wall, if made, would certainly explode!
Everyone worked at that wall; the nursing
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
staff, the coachman, an occasional visitor, a&nbsp;schoolboy,
a&nbsp;couple of boy scouts, members of the National Reserve who were
guarding a “vulnerable point” close by, and even some of the patients.
Patients as a rule will endure any toil with the utmost good temper if
it is for the purposes of sport. If the task is useful it does not
interest them. Still, a&nbsp;wall which might explode offered a certain
attraction. We worked with more zeal than discretion, but happily I had
it in my mind that homogeneity was the essential, and therefore the hard
nuggets of chalk as they were thrown into the shuttering to be
compressed by the rammers were first chopped up with spades, much as one
minces meat. The wall had no foundations. In Pisé you can make your
foundations, so to speak, as you go, through the simple process of
ramming. Anyway, and to cut a long story short, the wall was made, was
able to receive the roof, for which happily the local builder found some
material, and not only did the wall stand, but showed a very creditable
exterior. Its weight was of course enormous, for there were some twenty
tons of chalk put into it. In spite of the irregularity of the labour it
did not take more than ten or twelve days to build. To prevent the wet
and frost getting into it, I&nbsp;painted the main front with a patent
liquid material for rendering walls damp-proof. The Chalk Pisé wall not
only served its purpose, but served it very well. The room proved
extraordinarily warm and comfortable, largely owing no doubt to the fact
of a solid, very dry, 18-in. wall on the north-east side.</p>

<p>My next venture was in response to an urgent appeal from a farm
tenant to build him a waggon house. The result is seen in the
accompanying illustration. This building, about 40 ft. by 30 ft., was
made purely of earth, but some experiments were tried in the way of
introducing hurdles into the
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
shuttering in order to afford a surface to which plaster could easily
cling. Suffice it to say that the plain earth, without plaster or any
covering, more than justified itself. One part of the wall is very much
exposed to the weather, but it has stood the rains and the frosts of
three very bad winters without turning a hair. Lovers of the picturesque
may like to know that it presents a pleasant face of light ochre, upon
which a pale green efflorescence of lichen has appeared of late. Anyway,
the frost has not touched&nbsp;it.</p>

<h5><a name = "introIV" id = "introIV">IV</a></h5>

<p>Next I made some experiments in chalk farmyard walls. Unfortunately,
however, one of these, which was not made homogeneous by chalk mincing,
<i>i.e.</i> in which the nuggets of chalk were not properly broken up,
got the wet into it, and true to the candid friend’s prophecy did
literally explode in the big frost of 1917-18. Another very pretty chalk
wall is, however, standing to this day. But though Chalk Pisé will,
I&nbsp;think, do well if properly made and properly protected, it is
somewhat of a doubtful material for anything except a building with a
good overlay of roof. Another structure put up by me was a largish
gardener’s potting shed. This was built purely of earth, and in dry
weather. When the walls were perfectly dry, the local road authorities
kindly came with their tar spray and sprayed it with hot tar, with most
excellent results. The hot tar really entered instead of merely making a
skin, with the result that the external walls thus treated resembled a
section of tarred road stood up on end.</p>

<p>I may add that I lent my Pisé shuttering to a Guildford Volunteer
Battalion, who in a ten-hour day, or rather, two days of five hours
each, built an excellent hut about 20 ft. square and 10 ft. high, and
thus showed that a platoon might house themselves with Pisé in a day,
provided they had roofing material ready. This building had subsequently
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>
to be destroyed, because the ground on which it stood was wanted for
another purpose. When it was knocked down the house-breakers were
astonished at the strength and tenacity of the walls. Yet the earth out
of which they were made was particularly bad&mdash;as one of the
volunteers expressed it, not earth, but merely leaf-mould and
horse-manure. The site had, as a matter of fact, been a suburban garden
for at least two hundred years.</p>


<h5><a name = "introV" id = "introV">V</a></h5>

<p>Before I leave the record of these terrestrial adventures I may note
that in the early stages I received a great deal of help and
encouragement from General Sir Robert Scott-Moncrieff. He was indeed so
much struck by them that he drew up a series of instructions for walls
of Pisé work which were issued to all engineer companies at the front in
case they might have opportunities for experimenting. These instructions
were based upon the Australian book and embodied the very simple form of
shuttering there recommended. The diagram that accompanied them is
reproduced in the Appendix to the present volume.</p>

Pisé in Moulds</span></p>

<h5><a name = "introVI" id = "introVI">VI</a><br>
Pisé in Moulds</h5>

<p>There is one thing more to be said about Pisé. I&nbsp;believe that a
useful development of the system may be found in the plan of ramming
earth into moulds and making earth blocks, something like concrete
blocks. Moulds of this kind are easy to make and are specially suitable
when the soil is somewhat clayey in its nature. They have the advantage
of being much cheaper than shuttering, and of being capable of being
handled by one man without assistance. With a strong wooden mould and a
good rammer a small-holder may easily build his own pigsty, his
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
own chicken house, and all the small outbuildings he requires, if not
indeed add an extra room to his house. I&nbsp;am at present
experimenting with these blocks and only yesterday had the pleasure of
seeing a sergeant (R.A.M.C), discharged through ill-health and now
trying to turn himself into a small-holder, building a pigsty with the
help of one of my moulds.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of the elusive universality and yet non-existence of
Pisé work, the following personal anecdote or footnote to compressed
earth may amuse my readers. Happening to be sleeping in a bedroom at
Brooks’s Club in 1916, I&nbsp;noticed a charming Regency bookcase full
of old books. Among them was a copy of a <i>Cyclopædia</i> of 1819.
I&nbsp;thought it would be amusing to see whether there was any mention
of Pisé de terre. What was my astonishment to find that what I thought
was my own special and peculiar hobby and discovery was treated therein
at very great length and with very great ability, but treated not in the
least as anything new or wonderful, but instead as “this well-known and
greatly appreciated system of building, etc., etc.” To complete the
irony of the situation the fact was mentioned that a Mr. Holland had
lately sent to the Board of Agriculture a memorandum as to how to put up
houses and farm-buildings in this form of construction. My hair rose on
my head, for I had just committed a similar official indiscretion
myself, and had been bombarding appropriate authorities with what I
thought must be a complete novelty. Truly one can never be first or do
anything new. It is always “in the Files,” as Mr. Kipling says. Even in
our most original moments we only keep on feebly imitating somebody
else. The claim to originality is nothing but a muddy mixture

of pride and ignorance. What did, however, somewhat amaze me was the
calm statement of the <i>Cyclopædia</i> that this system of building was
now well known in the counties of&mdash;and then came the names of
practically all the counties of Southern England. And yet I had been
keenly on the look-out for such buildings for several years. The cynic
will say that they had all fallen down. That only shows the weakness of
the cynic’s point of view. The truth is they are often concealed under
various disguises of plaster, paint, and weather tiles. Few people know
what their own walls are really made of till they try to cut a new
opening for a door or a window in them.</p>

<p>Of Cob I know little by actual experiment. It is fully dealt with in
the body of this work, and readers will find that it is a kind of mud or
clay concrete reinforced with straw. It is therefore totally and
absolutely different from Pisé. One is wet, the other dry.</p>

A Postscript</h5>

<p>In the body of this work mention is made of a very successful
experiment in Pisé de terre made by the officials of a Rhodesian mining
company; the outcome, I&nbsp;am proud to think, of my pre-war advocacy
of Pisé in <i>The Spectator</i>. No sooner had my introduction been
finished than there came by way of postscript an exceedingly interesting
series of photographs, sent to me by Mr. Pickstone, a&nbsp;gentleman
very well known in South Africa for his fruit gardens, his
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
peaches, and his apricots. On the strength of what he had read in <i>The
Spectator</i>, Mr. Pickstone lately undertook to build a station
building and station-master’s house for the railway station at Simondium
in the Drakenstein Valley, a&nbsp;place which during the summer is noted
for its great heat. In the January number of the <i>South African
Railways and Harbours Magazine</i>, Mr. Pickstone gives a detailed
account of his bold and successful experiment and illustrates it by a
reproduction of some of his photographs. Here is his own account of what
he did.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Pisé&mdash;a South African Lead</span></p>

<p>“It must have been about eighteen months ago that the railway
administration decided to promote Simondium Siding to the dignity of a
station. As a siding, it had always been a busy place in the fruit
season, during which time a permanent checker had for some years been
kept quite busy, his accommodation being a couple of small tin shanties,
and he had been accustomed to board out where he could. Now we were to
have a ‘pukka’ station-master and, presumably, suitable premises. The
department quickly got to work and the station-master’s house arrived.
It was what one might call a second-hand, or even a third- or
fourth-hand one, consisting of the inevitable sheets of galvanised iron
and the ever-essential Oregon and Swedish timber. Our new station-master
also shortly afterwards arrived, and turned out to be a married man with
a wife and four children. The station-master was not a grouser, but
during the hot summer&mdash;and it is terribly hot in the Drakenstein
Valley during that time of the year&mdash;he complained to me that it
was almost impossible to hold on, owing to the conditions under which he
and his family had to live. It was just about this time that I saw in
<i>The Spectator</i> a series of articles strongly advocating ‘Pisé de
terre’ construction for buildings of all kinds; especially was it
recommended as a war-time expedient for rapid and economical
construction for barracks and
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
hospitals, and, indeed, it was strongly recommended by Mr. St. Loe
Strachey, the editor, for all sorts of general building and military
purposes. It is a curious fact, which many readers could verify, that
frequently one lives one’s life under certain conditions, and in reality
remains absolutely blind to their presence and potentialities. Here was
I, living in a country where some of the most beautiful old homesteads
are on the principle of the ‘Pisé de terre’ construction, and a large
proportion of the older farm buildings in this district also built of
similar material, with the additional pleasing accompaniment of
beautiful beams, ceilings and floors made of colonial pine&mdash;one may
advisedly add, the <i>despised</i> colonial pine. Some of these
buildings have stood the wear and use of close on a century, and are
still an object of joy to those privileged to have an eye to see. Here
lived I, as I say, blind to its potentialities for to-day, although it
had been clearly appreciated and carried out with the most charming and
solid results by our great-grandfathers in the old slave-labour
days.”</p>

designed by Mr. Herbert Baker.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The supervising architect, Mr. Kendall, who was responsible for
carrying out the work to the admirable design of Mr. Herbert Baker,
gives the following description of the way the work was actually
executed, which contains several very useful hints:</p>

<p class = "space">
“The construction of walls determined upon was that known as ‘Pisé de
terre,’ consisting of earth walls some 18 in. to 24 in. thick, which owe
their solidity to a simple process of ramming between wooden casings
previously placed in position on both sides. These walls are built in
stages of some 3&nbsp;ft. in height, the wood casing being raised at
intervals as required. The frames for doors and windows are placed in
position at the right time, and anchored into the walls by means of long
hoop iron ties. These walls, when completed, give a surface almost as
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
hard as burnt brick, but the external angles present a slight point of
weakness, as from their exposure they would be naturally inclined to
chip away in cases of rough usage. In order to overcome this it was
arranged that irregular brick quoins should be embedded in the angles
all the way up as the work proceeded. The walls, when completed, were
then plastered and whitewashed, and present as good an appearance as
more expensively plastered brickwork. As additional security the weather
sides were given, prior to whitewashing, a&nbsp;coat of hot gas tar
direct on the plaster, which in all exterior work was lime plus 10 per
cent. cement. The roofs are of thatch with a fairly good overhang at the
eaves in order to form a protection for the walls.”</p>

<p class = "space">
On one point, however, we may reassure Mr. Kendall. I&nbsp;do not think
he need be afraid of his walls being destroyed by the weather even if he
has no overhang. Part of a Pisé wall in my cart-shed, built in a very
exposed situation, has no overhang. Further, the wall is not covered by
cement or any other protective covering. The compressed earth was left
quite bare, and yet the three worst winters of alternating wet and frost
known for many years have made no impression upon the wall. It seems to
be both rain-proof and frost-proof.</p>

<p>I may add that Mr. Pickstone informs me in a letter dated February
19th that the Pisé walls have proved an enormous success from the point
of view of protection from the heat. Whereas in an iron building lined
with wood the temperature in the hot weather went up to 104 degrees
Fahrenheit, in the station-master’s Pisé de terre dining-room the
thermometer registered only 86 degrees. Those who have ever lived where
such temperatures prevail will note the immense advantage gained by the
Pisé walls. Such temperatures try strong men and women, and for children
they are positively death-dealing. With so successful an
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
experiment as that at Simondium before my eyes, I&nbsp;am beginning to
feel that I may live to correct my view that this universal system of
building is practised “no vairs.”</p>

<p>“<i>Have we not in Africa and in Spain walls of earth, known as
‘formocean’ walls? From the fact that they are moulded, rather than
built, by enclosing earth within a frame of boards, constructed on
either side. These walls will last for centuries, are proof against
rain, wind, and fire, and are superior in solidity to any cement. Even

<p><span class = "firstword">Always</span> necessity has been the mother
of invention. The war has proved her prolific indeed, and her teeming
offspring are seen in the multiplicity of war contrivances and the
bewildering array of substitutes for the once common things of our daily
life. Where necessity has been most dire, there invention has
unfailingly come to the rescue with the most amazing “Ersatz” products
to replace the vanished originals.</p>

<p>At any rate it pleases us to attribute the truly astonishing feats of
the Germans in this direction to their greater need rather than to any
superior ingenuity or enterprise on their part.</p>

<p>That their success was often no more than moderate will be readily
admitted by anyone who, for instance, has made trial of their “Ersatz”
cigars or ration coffee.</p>

<p>Still, need did at least awaken prodigious effort, ingenuity, and
enterprise&mdash;all co-ordinated and concentrated on the business of
making good a hundred paralysing deficiencies.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
The House Famine</span></p>

<p>In this present matter of National Housing the shortage of all the
generally recognised building materials as well as of actual houses is
extreme and grave. Effort, ingenuity, and enterprise in overcoming these
insufficiencies are as urgently and vitally necessary to England in
Peace as ever they were to Germany in war. Little will be said here of
the direct and intimate connection between good houses and good
citizens.</p>

<p>It is assumed that those who go to the pains of reading
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
this book have at least glanced at the Housing Reports, and drawn
certain disquieting conclusions from the criminal and vital statistics
with which the case for reform is reinforced.</p>

<p>In a recent speech the Registrar-General said: “War does not only
fill the graves, it also empties the cradles.” This is no less true of
bad and inadequate housing.</p>

<p>Only the most reckless and thick-skinned of the poorer population
will adventure on marriage and the bringing up of a family whilst the
odds against decent and reasonable housing persist as at present.</p>

<p>True, “Housing” is very properly being given considerable prominence
in the press, and scarcely a day passes but there appears an article or
letter dealing with this question.</p>

<p>Usually we are left but little wiser than we were, whilst if we
chance to know something about the subject, the general tone of vague
cheerfulness that pervades them all fills us with misgiving.</p>

<p>Nothing is easier or pleasanter or more popular than to make airy
promises or predictions about the “Homes for Happy Human Beings” that,
somehow, are to be prepared for our returned soldiers, and for all those
others who are housed miserably or not at all. It is very easy to
predict and promise, but without adequate materials performance is not
merely difficult, it is impossible.</p>

<p>There is a world-shortage of almost every manufactured or cultivated
product; there is also a labour famine, a&nbsp;money famine, and a
transport famine.</p>

<p>In this country, closely connected with these deficiencies and
looming ominously over them all, is, as we have said, our
house-famine.</p>

<p>To relieve the last in face of the others, and without further
aggravating them, is one of the most grave and pressing of the many
problems that confront&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>Briefly the problem is this: To provide a maximum of
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
new housing with a minimum expenditure of labour, money, transport, and
manufactured materials.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, so far as rural housing is concerned, the solution
must be sought through the use of natural materials already existing on
the site, materials that can be worked straight into the fabric of the
building, without any elaborate or costly conversion, and that by local
labour.</p>

<p>“Pisé de Terre,” “Chalk Compost,” and “Cob” are three alternative
forms of construction, one of which will usually fulfil the above
conditions in any given situation.</p>

<p>Despite the somewhat outlandish and high-sounding name of the first,
it is nothing more than a very old and very simple method of building,
recently revived through stress of circumstances. The rude technique has
happily been kept alive and preserved for us in out-of-the-way corners
of the Continent and in our Colonies. Wherever there is a sufficiency of
sunshine to effect the necessary drying, there have earth buildings
arisen and prospered.</p>

<p>“Cob” building needs less introduction, as it is still well
understood and a living craft in several parts of Great Britain, notably
in Devonshire and South Wales, where its merits and advantages have been
recognised apparently from the earliest times.</p>

<p>All those indeed who are familiar with this method of construction
are fully alive to its virtues, and the same is true of Pisé-building,
both in chalk and earth, and also of clay-lump.</p>

<p>This book, however, is addressed to those who have in the past built
only with stone, brick, concrete, timber and plaster, etc., and who are
only now considering a reversion to the more primitive construction here
described, through the shortage or absolute lack of their former
materials.</p>

<p>It is not so much a question as to whether a Cob or Pisé house is
preferable to one of brick or stone or concrete&mdash;though there are
many who profess a lively preference for the former&mdash;but as to
whether you will boldly revert to
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29" id = "page29"> </a>
these old and well-tried methods of building, or, in the absence of the
ordinary materials, feebly sit down and build nothing at all.</p>

<p>For that will, inevitably, be the alternative for a great many
private persons. National and Public-Utility Housing Schemes and public
and industrial works of all sorts will naturally and properly claim
priority in the matter of all building materials&mdash;and the private
individual, so far as he can secure such materials at all, will only do
so at a price that is the logical outcome of an unprecedented demand and
an ominously inadequate supply.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Local Materials</span></p>

<p>Timber, tiles, slates, plaster, and ironmongery he must still
purchase and transport as best he may&mdash;but the shell of his house,
its outer walls at least, could and should be raised from the soil of
the site itself by the employment of the simplest gear and a small
amount of unskilled local labour.</p>

<p>So acute indeed is the transport problem, and so small is the hope of
any substantial improvement in the near future, that any expedient
tending to ease matters in this respect is worthy of the most serious
attention.</p>

<p>The restrictions imposed by high freights will of themselves tend to
check the often senseless and unnecessary importation of materials
foreign to a district, which in the past was the despair of architects
of the “traditional” school.</p>

<p>It was a wasteful practice that had gone far to obliterate all but
the most robust traits in the old and very diverse local building
conventions of rural England.</p>

<p>Formerly, he who wilfully carried bricks into Merioneth or the
Cotswolds, or slates into Kent or ragstone-rubble into Middlesex, was
guilty of no more than foolishness and an æsthetic solecism.</p>

<p>Under present conditions such action should render him liable to
prosecution and conviction on some such count as “Wasting the shrunken
resources of his country
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
in a time of great scarcity, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in that he did wantonly
transport material for building the walls of a house by rail and road
from A to B when suitable and sufficient material of another sort and at
no higher cost existed, and was readily accessible hard by the site
at&nbsp;B.”</p>

<p>That indeed is our one chance of salvation, the existence and use of
“the materials of another sort hard by the site.”</p>

<p>These natural materials and their appropriate use in building will be
considered in the following pages.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">If</span> ever the counties of England
recover their bygone loyalty to their own materials and their old
traditions, then cob-building will return to Devon and the West. Cheap
bricks, cheap transport, and the ignoble rage for fashions from the town
went far to oust provincial cob from the affections of those whom, with
their forbears, it had housed so well for several centuries.</p>

<p>Whether the new loyalty be from within, or be imposed from without by
force of circumstances, matters little. What does matter is the fact of
its revival.</p>

<p>For with it will come again the building of cottages that are knit
intimately to their sites and surroundings as of old, cottages
consanguineous with the ground they stand on, be it brick-earth, rock,
or common soil.</p>

<p>The soil of Devonshire and of many parts of Wessex and of Wales
serves excellently well for building in cob or “clom.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a></p>

<p>The soil itself suggested the construction, and the men of Wessex
were quick to take the hint and to act on&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The yeomen and small-holders of earlier days were commonly builders
too, and often built their own homes in their own way, yet by the
guiding light of local tradition.</p>

<p>Thus the old Devonian countryman in need of a house would set to and
build it himself&mdash;of stone if that were handy and easily worked, of
cob if it were not.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34" id = "page34"> </a>
<p>No doubt the doors and windows would be made and fitted by the
village wheelwright; but the cottager himself would thatch or slate the
roof as naturally and successfully as he built.</p>

<p>The skill and care with which these versatile amateurs built their
houses was not always of the highest, and careless construction, like
other sins, is visited on the children&mdash;the worse the sooner.</p>

<p>Thus it is that there are to-day plenty of old cob cottages that are
both damp and insecure, but to condemn cob building in general because
certain old builders were careless, ignorant, or incompetent is to
condemn all materials from wattle and daub to ferro-concrete in the same
breath.</p>

<p>Cob, being a humble, amenable, and thoroughly accommodating
substance, has reaped the inevitable reward of good nature in being “put
upon” and in being asked to stand what is quite beyond its powers of
endurance, and yet Devon cob houses of Elizabethan date are not
uncommon.</p>

<p>It is very reasonable in its demands, but two things it does
require&mdash;dry foundations and a good protecting roof.</p>

<p>To quote an old Devonshire saw on cob&mdash;“Giv’un a gude hat and
pair of butes an’ ’er’l last for ever.”</p>

<p>In many instances the Devonshire leaseholder, usually only a
“life-lease” holder, built badly and on indifferent foundations. He
neglected to repair his thatch, with the consequence that ruin followed
sooner or later. He did not always use rough-cast, so that it often
happened that by the time the lease expired the unfortunate landowner
found that the cottage fell in&mdash;in the literal as well as in the
legal sense. The lower portions of the walls were honey-combed with
rat-holes, the walls bulged out or fissures resulted from subsidence,
and the dwelling presented that appearance of squalor and meanness that
has led so many to decry the mud buildings of Devon as relics of bygone
barbarism. But if adequate care is bestowed on the construction, there
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<a name = "page35" id = "page35"> </a>
is no reason why cob cottages should not prove at one and the same time
comfortable to the inmates and pleasant to the eye, and endure for many
generations.</p>

The Beauty of Cob</span></p>

<p>As to their comeliness and longevity, a day’s walk in Devon, or,
failing that, a&nbsp;glance at the printed pictures will tell all that
need be told. That the beauty of cob buildings is not due merely to the
irregularities and weathering produced by the passage of time is
sufficiently proved by the photographs of Mr. Gimson’s charming cob
cottage, taken soon after he had finished&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The work was done a year or two before the war; this is Mr. Gimson’s
own description of the manner of its building:</p>

<p class = "space">
“The cob was made of the stiff sand found on the site; this was mixed
with water and a great quantity of long wheat straw trodden into it. The
walls were built 3&nbsp;ft. thick, pared down to 2&nbsp;ft. 6&nbsp;in.,
and were placed on a plinth standing 18 in. above the ground floor, and
built of cobble stones found among the sand. The walls were given a coat
of plaster and a coat of rough-cast, which was gently trowelled over to
smooth the surface slightly. I&nbsp;believe eight men were engaged on
the cobwork, some preparing the material, and others treading in on to
the top of the walls. It took them about three months to reach the wall
plate; the cost was 6<i>s.</i> a cubic yard, exclusive of the
plastering. No centring was used. The joists rested on plates, and above
them the walls were reduced to 2&nbsp;ft. 2&nbsp;in. in thickness to
leave the ends of the joists free. The beams also rested on wide plates
and the ends were built round with stone, leaving space for ventilation.
Tile or slate lintels were used over all openings. The cost of the whole
house was 6½<i>d.</i> a cubic foot. Building with cob is soon
learnt&mdash;of the eight men, only one of them had had any previous
experience, and, I&nbsp;believe, he had not built with it for thirty
years. This is the only house I have built of cob.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
<p>What is most interesting in this narrative is the workmen’s lack of
experience, which seems to have been no hindrance. Anyone who proposes
to revive the use of cob may take courage from Mr. Gimson’s evidence.
The time spent in building the walls was reasonable and the cost low. It
may be guessed that the post-war rise in cost will be no greater in
proportion, if as great, when compared with brickwork. The natural charm
of the wall surface is enhanced by the crown of thatched roof, modelled

Method of Building</h5>

<p><i>Composition.</i>&mdash;Cob is a mixture of shale and clay, straw
and water. Shale is a common and widely distributed stratified formation
of a slaty nature, and there are few types of clay soil that would not
serve for cob-making.</p>

<p>The precise relative proportion of the first two ingredients varies,
depending on their individual peculiarities.</p>

<p>Local custom as to the composition and preparation of the mixture
will generally be found to have adjusted itself to the peculiarities of
the soil.</p>

<p>The following extract is from an analyst’s report on a sample of
typical old cob walling:</p>

<p>(N.B.&mdash;Lime is occasionally added to the clay-shale, but this is
not usual.)</p>

<p><i>Mixing.</i>&mdash;The old method of mixing by hand is as follows:
A&nbsp;“bed” of clay-shale is formed close to the wall where it is to be
used, sufficient to do one perch. A&nbsp;perch is superficial
measurement described as 16½ ft. long, 1&nbsp;ft. high, and the amount
of material will vary according to the thickness of wall required. Four
men usually work together. The big stones are picked out. The material
is arranged in a circular heap about 5&nbsp;or 6 ft. in diameter.</p>

<p>Starting at the edge the men turn over the material with cob picks,
standing and treading on the material all the time. One man sprinkles on
water, and another sprinkles on barley straw from a wisp held under his
left arm. The heap is then turned over again in the other direction,
treading continuing all the time. “Twice turning” is usually considered
sufficient. Straw bands may be wrapped puttee-wise around the legs of
the men to keep them clean, and these are removed at the end of the
day.</p>

<p>More rarely the mixing is done in a rough trough, whilst a
power-driven “pan-mill” has also been tried with success; though one
would think that the use of such a machine might tend to diminish the
binding strength of the straw submitted to its grinding.</p>

<p><i>Building.</i>&mdash;In building a man stands on the low base-wall,
and lays the material handed up to him on the cob

picks, treading it into position. Thorough treading is important, and
the heels should be well used. The material is allowed to project each
side an inch or so beyond the stone base to allow for paring down
afterwards. The courses are usually about 2&nbsp;ft. high. The cob
should&nbsp;be
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
laid and trodden in diagonal layers, as shown in the diagram: this is to
secure proper bonding. It takes from two to three weeks for a course to
dry, according to the weather, and five or six men would be required to
build the walls of an ordinary cottage. This would not keep them
continuously employed, however, and they would require to have several
buildings in hand at the same time, so as to be able to turn from one to
the other while the courses were drying.</p>

<p class = "caption smaller">
COB COURSE, OR SCAR, SHOWING DIAGONAL LAYERS.</p>

<p>At the completion of a course the corners are plumbed up from the
stone base below, a&nbsp;line is stretched through and the wall is then
pared down “plumb” with the “paring iron” by the man standing on the
wall. Sometimes, however, the paring down is left until the wall is
finished and dry. Four men will do about four perches per day of a wall
2&nbsp;ft. thick, preparing and laying material.</p>

<p>The material is rarely laid between timber shuttering as in Pisé
work, as the retaining boards tend seriously to retard the drying
out.</p>

<p><i>Drying.</i>&mdash;If a course takes from two to three weeks to
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>
dry, it naturally takes a long time for a whole cottage to completely
dry out. The walls can be built from about March to September. The
internal fitting, plastering, etc., can be done in the winter, but the
external rendering must not be done for at least a year, perhaps two
years, to allow the walls to become perfectly dry.</p>

<p>As unprotected cob is sensitive to frost, especially if not
thoroughly dried out, it should be given a good external rendering as
soon as it is really dry, and should in the meantime be protected from
frost by some temporary covering, straw-matting or what not. Also all
cob-work must be protected from the rain both whilst building and when
built.</p>

<p>No artificial methods of drying are at present usual, beyond good
fires inside during the winter, though, as under such conditions a cob
cottage is not usually considered fit to live in for several months
after completion, some artificial means of drying might be worth
considering.</p>

<p><i>Foundations and Base.</i>&mdash;The depth of the excavations
required for the foundations naturally depends upon the character of the
site and soil, as also does the spread of the footings, if any.</p>

<p>The base-course wall of brick, stone, or concrete should be carried
up some 2&nbsp;ft. or so above ground level. In old days this walling
was not infrequently built “dry”&mdash;but good lias lime or cement
should be used in all new work.</p>

<p>The damp-course too was an unknown refinement to the by-gone
builders, and the introduction of this one improvement alone makes the
new cob cottage a very different dwelling from the old.</p>

<p>The usual forms of damp-course serve well for cob walls, though
slates laid butt and broken joint in cement are probably the best.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Walls and Roofs</span></p>

<p><i>Thickness of Walls.</i>&mdash;The thickness of walls may be
anything
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
you please from 18 in. upwards. There are old examples a full 3&nbsp;ft.
across, but for an ordinary two-storied cottage a thickness of about
2&nbsp;ft. is general. Eighteen inches is certainly the minimum
thickness, and would not ordinarily be adopted for any but one-storied
buildings.</p>

<p>The first-floor walls are made the same thickness as those below, for
if they were reduced in width, as is usual in a stone building, the
extra weight thus thrown on to one side of the ground floor walls would
tend to make them bulge, unless quite dry and thoroughly set.</p>

<p>There are old cob walls in existence fully 30 ft. in height, and
there is no apparent limit in this direction provided they are thick
enough.</p>

<p>The upper layers compress the lower ones, and automatically render
them more dense and stone-like and fit to bear the load imposed
above.</p>

<p><i>Hipped Roofs.</i>&mdash;As a general rule, however, it is found
expedient to hip back the roof rather than carry it up in a tall gable,
partly because cob-building at a great height above the ground in short
and diminishing layers is a somewhat tedious process, partly because a
hipped roof with good eaves is very welcome for the protection that its
projection affords the walling.</p>

WALL COPINGS.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Masonry and Carpentry.</i>&mdash;The bonding of cob to stone and
brick is sometimes liable to leave an open joint that will require
filling when the cob dries and shrinks. Many of the chimneys in old cob
houses are of brick or stone, and brick and stone jambs are sometimes to
be seen in cob walls, but they are probably by way of repairs to damaged
corners. It is considered better to have cob all round, so ensuring the
uniform settlement of the building.</p>

<p>The timber built into old cob does not seem to decay. The walls are
usually so dry, especially when plastered, that the wood is well
preserved. The straw in the interior of old cob walls is often as bright
as when put in. The straw in cob performs a similar function to hair in
plaster.
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>

Heather has sometimes been used instead of straw with good results.</p>

LINTEL-BEARING CROSS-PIECE</p>
</div>

<p>The old practice was for beams, wall plates, joists, etc., to be just
bedded on the cob, and for the cob to be filled in between the joists.
In new work, particularly when the use of imperfectly seasoned timber is
unavoidable, it would be wise to take the usual precautions as to the
proper ventilation of all “built in” woodwork&mdash;especially the ends
of joists and so forth. Roofs must of course be tied and exercise no
thrust on walls. The roof plates are sometimes tied down by galvanised
iron wire.</p>

<p>Door and window-frames are also fixed to wood blocks built into the
jambs and to the wood lintels above. The frames are sometimes near the
outer face of wall, sometimes
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<a name = "page43" id = "page43"> </a>
near the inner-face. Where the door-frames are on the interior face of a
2&nbsp;ft. thick wall, a&nbsp;convenient porch results.</p>

<p>Other joinery is fixed to wood pins driven into the cob where
required.</p>

<p>Corners are usually of cob, though stone quoins are occasionally met
with.</p>

<p>Lintels are usually of wood well tailed into the wall and resting on
a wood pad placed crosswise.</p>

Protection</span></p>

<p><i>Protection.</i>&mdash;Old buildings that have been neglected are
often found to be somewhat eroded towards the bottom of their walls
through the action of rain and frost.</p>

<p>Protection is less here than higher up under the projecting eaves,
and the Achilles’ heel of the cob wall is undoubtedly its base.</p>

<p>This vulnerable part, exposed as it is to driven rain, back-splash,
and the casual kicks, should be given special protection.</p>

<p>Where the base is of cob and not of masonry, the traditional method
is to provide a good deep skirting of pitch or tar, or a mixture of
both, applied hot to the face of the rendering that should completely
cover the exterior of all cob work.</p>

<p>This rendering is usually composed of lime and hair mortar, though
Portland cement has come into use to some extent recently.</p>

<p>Cement, however, is apt to be rather too “short” and brittle, and it
does not always hold to the cob walling very securely.</p>

<p>A rendering consisting of an equal mixture of cement and lime with
three parts of sand adheres well to cob, however, and is probably the
best coating that can be given to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>This coating can be colour-washed or lime-whited in the usual way.
The granular surface of rough rendering or of “slap-dash” on the
slightly wavy surface of cob
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
walling perhaps gives to whitewash its very highest opportunity and
charm.</p>

<p>Certain it is that the old cob cottages of Devon with the pearly
gleam of their white walls, their heaving bulk of thatch and their trim
black skirtings, are as gracious and as pleasant to the eye as any in
all the length and breadth of England.</p>

<p>Within, lime-and-hair mortar plastered straight on to the cob makes
an excellent lining.</p>

<p><i>Chimneys.</i>&mdash;Nowadays, chimneys are commonly built up in
brick or stone, but numerous good examples survive of flues and stacks
constructed in cob. The insides of these are pargeted with lime and
cow-dung in the usual way, brickwork being only introduced immediately
around the fireplaces.</p>

<p><i>Rats.</i>&mdash;Where the surface rendering of cob-walls has been
omitted or has been allowed to fall away, an enterprising rat will
sometimes do considerable damage by his tunnelling.</p>

<p>A little powdered glass mixed with the lower strata of a wall will
discourage any such burrowing, but the best preservative for any cob
building is a thoroughly good skin of rendering, especially if this be
reinforced by fine-mesh wire-netting secured to the wall.</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i>&mdash;The strength of cob walls is surprisingly
great so long as they are vertical, and are not subjected to undue
lateral thrust or tension.</p>

<p>Beams as large as 12 in. by 12 in. may be seen supported by old cob
walls, and there is nothing likely to be asked of the material in the
way of strength to which it cannot easily respond.</p>

<p><i>Design.</i>&mdash;Cob, like every other material, should have a
certain say in the design of any building in which its use is
intended.</p>

<p>The chief desiderata are a plain straightforward plan and broadly
treated elevations where voids and solids are
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
carefully disposed with an eye to getting as large unbroken blocks of
cob as possible.</p>

<p>The cracks that are sometimes found in old cob buildings are almost
entirely attributable to unsuitable design in such respects, or to bad
foundations.</p>

<p>Cob walls built up in the ordinary way are not very suitable for
internal partitions on account of their considerable width and the
consequent waste of space, though in old work cob was sometimes used as
a filling for stud and lath partitions which were finally plastered over
in the usual way.</p>

<p>The sun-dried clay-lumps so much used for walling in Suffolk would
seem to be admirable for forming the partitions in a house of cob.</p>

<p>Cob work is usually repaired with rubble, stone, or brick.</p>

<p>New openings are easily cut through cob walls, and this fact has
occasionally led to the collapse of an old building through the zeal for
light and air of some new occupier exceeding his caution, and causing
him to cut away the substance of his walls in cheerful disregard of the
laws of gravity.</p>

<p>Not by any means was cob exclusively the poor man’s material, and
several old homes of this sort still survive that are of some
consideration.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Raleigh’s House</span></p>

<p>Amongst them is Hayes Barton, the birthplace of Sir Walter Raleigh.
Writing of Raleigh and his home, Mr. Charles Bernard says:</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>Sir Walter Raleigh’s House.</i>&mdash;“He had great affection for his
boyhood’s home&mdash;the old manor-house at Hayes
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
Barton where he was born, and did his best to secure it from its then
owner. ‘I&nbsp;will,’ he wrote, ‘most willingly give you whatsoever in
your conscience you shall deme it worth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for ye naturall
disposition I have to that place, being borne in that house, I&nbsp;had
rather see myself there than anywhere else.’ But alas! it was not to be,
and the snug and friendly Tudor homestead passed into other hands. The
house at Hayes Barton was probably not newly built when Raleigh’s
parents lived there, and it says much for the character of cob that the
house is as good to-day as ever it was; though for all that it has, to
use Mr. Eden Phillpotts’ words, ‘been patched and tinkered through the
centuries,’ it ‘still endures, complete and sturdy, in harmony of old
design, with unspoiled dignity from a far past.’ Lady Rosalind Northcote
gives the following description of the house in her <i>Devon</i>. She
writes: “In front of the garden, a&nbsp;swirling stream crosses a strip
of green; and in the garden, at the right time, one may see the bees
busy among golden-powdered clusters of candytuft, and dark red
gillyflowers, and a few flame rose-coloured tulips, proud and erect. The
house is very picturesque; it has cob walls and a thatched roof, and is
built in the shape of the letter <span class = "sans">E</span>; a wing
projects at either end, and in the middle the porch juts out slightly.
The two wings are gabled; there is a small gable over the porch and two
dormer ones over the windows at each side of it, the windows having
lattice lights and narrow mullions. Dark carved beams above them show up
well against the cream-coloured walls. The heavy door is closely studded
with nails, and over it fall the delicate sprays and lilac “butterfly”
blossoms of wistaria.’”</p>

Coping.</span></p>

<p><i>Reed Thatch.</i>&mdash;In recent years slates or tiles have
replaced thatch for the roofing of cob buildings and walls, owing to the
cost of reed (the local name for the straw from
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page47" id = "page47"> </a>
which the grain has been hand-threshed by flail to prevent the straw
being broken), and the difficulty of getting good thatchers. The opinion

since the practice of liming the cornland has unfortunately been
given&nbsp;up.</p>

<p><i>Primitive Methods.</i>&mdash;Formerly the ground floors of cob
cottages were all cobbled, but these have, generally speaking, been
replaced by lime, ash, or cement floors. The cob builders of past
generations apparently made no use of the square, plumb-line, or level.
No laths were used for the walls, which were plastered within; outside,
rough-cast or “slap-dash” was laid&nbsp;on.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Mr. Baring-Gould</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Baring-Gould’s Testimony.</i>&mdash;Mr. S. Baring-Gould, in
his <i>Book of the West</i>, writing on the subject says: “No house can
be considered more warm and cosy than that built of cob, especially when
thatched. It is warm in winter and cool in summer, and I have known
labourers bitterly bewail their fate in being transferred from an old
fifteenth or sixteenth century cob cottage into a newly-built stone
edifice of the most approved style, as they said it was like going out
of warm life into a cold grave.”</p>


<h6>DEVON COB</h6>

<p>The following paragraph, taken from C. B. Allen’s
<i>Cottage-Building</i>, is of interest:</p>

<p>“The cob walls of Devonshire have been known to last above a century
without requiring the slightest repair, and the Rev. W. Elicombe, who
has himself built several houses of two stories with cob walls, says
that he was born in a cob-wall parsonage built in the reign of
Elizabeth, or somewhat earlier, and that it had to be taken down to be
rebuilt only in the year 1831.”</p>

<p><i>Fruit Walls.</i>&mdash;Again quoting Mr. Baring-Gould: “Cob walls
for garden fruit are incomparable. They retain the warmth of the sun and
give it out through the night,
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
and when protected on top by slates, tiles, or thatch, will last for
centuries.” It will be seen that the disadvantages of cob buildings are
solely due to faults of construction, and not to any inherent defect in
properly made cob as a material, and that the construction of cottages,
farm buildings, and garden walls is well within the compass of an
averagely intelligent workman.</p>

<p>It is not intended to argue that the cob cottage could be
advantageously built in every county, but only that where it has been
used and liked for centuries, a&nbsp;wise building policy would
encourage its continuance. The materials are at hand, and the population
ready to welcome this form of dwelling-place.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Old Cob Lore</span></p>

<p><i>An Old Authority.</i>&mdash;An old writer treating of
cottage-building thus delivers himself:</p>

<p class = "space">
“A Bill for inclosing the waste lands of the kingdom having been
introduced into the House of Commons, under the auspices of the Board of
Agriculture, and as so beneficial a Bill cannot fail, sooner or later,
to pass into a law, and as in consequence thereof, many small houses
must necessarily be built, suited to small estates issuing out of
allotments of such wastes, we have been induced to submit to the
consideration of the Board three plans of such small houses to be built
of different species of materials.</p>

<p>“The first is with mud walls, composed of soft mire and straw, well
trodden together, and which, by degrees, is laid on,
stratum-super-stratum, to the height required; a&nbsp;species of
building not uncommon for cottages, and even for better houses, barns,
etc., in the western and some other parts of the kingdom. It is the
cheapest habitation that we can construct and is also very dry and
comfortable.”</p>

<p class = "space">
And again:</p>

<p class = "space">
“Walls of mud, or of compressed earth, are still more
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
economical than those of timber, and if they were raised on brick or
stone foundations, the height of a foot or 18 in. above the ground, or
above the highest point at which dung or moist straw was ever likely to
be placed against them, their durability would be equal to that of
marble, if properly constructed and kept perfectly dry. The cob walls of
Devonshire, which are formed of clay and straw trodden together by oxen,
have been known to last above a century without requiring the slightest
repair; and we think that there are many farmers, especially in America
and Australia, who if they knew how easily walls of this description
could be built, would often avail themselves of them for various
agricultural purposes.</p>

<p>“The solidity of cob walls depends much upon their not being hurried
in the process of making them, for if hurried, the walls will surely be
crippled, that is, they will swag or swerve from the perpendicular. It
is usual to pare down the sides of each successive rise before another
is added to it. The instrument used for this purpose is like a baker’s
peel (a&nbsp;kind of wooden shovel for taking the bread out of the
oven), but the cob-parer is made of iron. The lintels of the doors and
windows and of the cupboards and other recesses are put in as the work
advances (allowance being made for their settling), bedding them on
cross pieces, and the walls being carried up solid. The respective
openings are cut out after the work is well settled. In Devonshire the
builders of cob-wall houses like to begin their work when the birds
begin to build their nests, in order that there may be time to cover in
the shell of the building before winter. The outer walls are plastered
the following spring. Should the work be overtaken by winter before the
roof is on, it is usual to put a temporary covering of thatch upon the
walls, to protect them from the frost.”</p>

Mr. Fulford’s Evidence</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Fulford’s Evidence.</i>&mdash;Mr. Fulford, of Great Fulford,
near Exeter, whose own village and estate can show as
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50" id = "page50"> </a>
many good examples of old cob work as any place in Devon, writes as
follows:</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>Cost.</i>&mdash;“It is not possible to give a close estimate of what
would now be the comparative cost of a building in cob, stone, or brick,
as this must depend upon the exact locality of the site. It may,
however, be of assistance if I quote particulars of the relative cost of
cob and stone building in Devon in the year 1808 when cob was in common
use. The stonework referred to was rough rubble, and not with square or
dressed blocks. It must be borne in mind that up to that date
practically all material, stone, lime, etc., was carried on horses’
backs. Wheeled carts which began to creep in about the beginning of
1800, were not in general use until twenty or thirty years later. As a
boy I knew a farmer who remembered the first wheeled cart coming to
Dunsford. In 1838 the Rector of Bridford (the ‘Christowell’ of
Blackmore’s novel) recorded the fact that in 1818 there was only one
cart in the parish and it was scarcely used twice a year. In 1808 the
price of building varied according to the district. In the northern part
of the county the common price of stonework, including the value of
three quarts of cider or beer daily, was from 22<i>d.</i> to 24<i>d.</i>
the perch (16½&nbsp;ft.), 22 in. in width and 1&nbsp;ft. in height.
Including all expenses of quarrying and carriage of materials, stonework
worked out at from 5<i>s.</i> to 6<i>s.</i> per perch running measure,
and cob estimated in like manner at about 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Masons
when not employed by the piece received 2<i>s.</i> per day, and
allowance of beer or cider. In the Dunstone district (the clay shales
from which make the best cob) masonwork was 18<i>d.</i> per rope of 20
ft. in length, 18 in. thick, and 1&nbsp;ft. high, stone and all
materials found and placed on the spot; cob work of the same measure was
14<i>d.</i> In the South Hams district masonwork cost 2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>, and cob 2<i>s.</i> per perch of 18 ft. in length, 2&nbsp;ft.
thick, and 1&nbsp;ft. high.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
<p><i>Use of Shuttering.</i>&mdash;“In those parts of the red land where
Dunstone shillot or clay shale is not available, the red clay was mixed
with small stones or gravel, and frequently the cob was laid and trodden
down between side boards as used in building concrete walls. Three
cartloads of clay built a perch and a half of wall 20 in. wide and
1&nbsp;ft. deep. Eight bundles of barley straw, equal to one pack-horse
load, were mixed and tempered with nine cartloads of clay.”</p>

<p><i>Roofing.</i>&mdash;“Thatching in 1808 cost 8<i>s.</i> per square
of 10 ft.; 100 sheaves of wheat-straw reed, weighing 25 lb. each, were
sufficient for one square. Thatching, however, is not, as many suppose,
indispensable as a roofing for cob buildings; slate found in many parts
of Devon was frequently used, and of late years Welsh and Delabole
slates, tiles, and unfortunately, from the picturesque point of view,
corrugated iron, have to a large extent supplanted thatch.”</p>

<p><i>A Protective Wash.</i>&mdash;“Vancouver, in his report on the
Survey of Devon for the Board of Agriculture in 1808, gave the following
recipe, which he described as a preserving and highly ornamental wash
for rough-cast that was then getting into common use: ‘Four parts of
pounded lime, three of sand, two of pounded wood ashes, and one of
scoria of iron, mixed well together and made sufficiently fluid to be
applied with a brush. When dry it gives the appearance of new Portland
stone, and affords an excellent protection against the penetrating force
of the south-westerly storms<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has single quote">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p><i>Rendering.</i>&mdash;“For the rough-weather sides of cob buildings
I have found cement and sand, finished with a rough surface,
satisfactory, and far more durable than ordinary lime and gravel rough
cast. For interior cob walls, laths are not necessary. The old
plastering was frequently laid on too thick. Of late years I have used
with excellent results granite silicon plaster for ceilings and walls.
This requires no hair, and is easily applied<ins class = "correction"

<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page52" id = "page52"> </a>
<p><i>The Cob Tradition.</i>&mdash;“Cob-making was, like many other
local trades, carried on in some families from generation to generation
and developed by them into an art, but apart from these specialists,
practically every village mason and his labourers built as much with cob
as they did with stone. There are men still left in various parts of the
county who have made cob, and it would, in my opinion, be of advantage
if demonstrations could be given by them to discharged sailors and
soldiers who are anxious to take up work on the land.”</p>

<p><i>Training of ex-Soldiers.</i>&mdash;“In cob-building, as in many
other arts and crafts, a&nbsp;little showing is of far greater help to
the novice than any amount of text-book instruction. The knowledge and
experience that these men would gain from being shown, and better still,
assisting an expert in making cob, would be of material advantage in the
development of the county scheme promoted by the Central Land
Association for the establishment of ex-Service men on the land. They
could try their ’prentice hands on walls, tool-sheds, cart linhays,
etc., for their own use, and some no doubt would develop into expert
builders capable of constructing walls for dwelling-houses from approved
plans.”</p>

<p><i>1819 Conditions Returned.</i>&mdash;“The depletion of our
home-grown timber supply and the prohibitive cost of practically all
building material has in effect brought about the conditions that led
our forefathers to utilise suitable material that lay nearest to hand,
and unless some endeavour is made to follow their methods and profit by
their example, it will be impossible to provide sufficient buildings for
the necessary equipment of the allotments and small holdings, let alone
housing accommodation for the workers on the land.”</p>

A Champion of Cob</span></p>

<p>There is probably no one who knows more about cob than does Mr.
Fulford&mdash;certainly no one who has done
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
more to promote the revival of cob-building both by precept and
example.</p>

<p>Cob is the traditional material of his native place, he has, as it
were, been brought up on cob&mdash;he is familiar with both the ancient
history and the modern practice of cob-building, and in short, he
“knows.”</p>

<p>When a revivalist has knowledge as well as enthusiasm, the grounds of
his faith are usually worth serious attention.</p>

considerable areas where the soil would, if tried, prove well adapted
for cob-building.</p>

General</h5>

<p><i>What it is.</i>&mdash;“Pisé de terre” is merely the French for
rammed earth, and rammed earth is an exceedingly good material for the
building of walls.</p>

<p>The odd thing is that its very obvious merits should have secured it
such small attention.</p>

<p>It is no new-fangled war-time invention brought forth by our present
necessity, but a very ancient system well proved by centuries of
trial.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Pliny gives an excellent account of
Pisé-building in his <i>Natural History</i>, and Monsieur Gorffon, who
published a treatise on this method of construction in 1772, states that
it was first introduced into France by the Romans.</p>

<p>The following extracts from an old book based on a French original
will serve well as an introduction to the study of Pisé-building:</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>Capabilities.</i>&mdash;“An account of a method of building strong
and durable houses, with no other materials than earth; which has been
practised for ages in the province of Lyons, though little known in the
rest of France, or in any other part of Europe. It appeared to be
attended with so many advantages, that many gentlemen in this country
who employ their leisure in the study of rural economy were induced to
make a trial of its efficiency; and the result of their experiments has
been of such a nature as
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58" id = "page58"> </a>
to make them desire, by all possible means, to extend the knowledge and
practice of so beneficial an art.</p>

<p>“The possibility of raising the walls of houses two or even three
stories high, with earth only, which will sustain floors loaded with the
heaviest weights, and of building the largest manufactories in this
manner, may astonish every one who has not been an eye-witness of such
things.”</p>

<p><i>Of Pisé and its Origin.</i>&mdash;“Pisé is a very simple manual
operation; it is merely by compressing earth in moulds or cases, that we
may arrive at building houses of any size or height.”</p>

<p><i>Locale.</i>&mdash;“This art, though at present confined to the
single province of the Lyonese in France, was known and practised at a
very early period of antiquity. The Abbé Rozier, in his <i>Journal de
Physique</i>, says that he has discovered some traces of it (Pisé) in
Catalonia; so that Spain, like France, has a single province in which
this ancient manner of building has been preserved. The art, however,
well deserves to be introduced into more general use. The cheapness of
the materials which it requires, and the great saving of time and labour
which it admits of, must recommend it in all places and on all
occasions, but the French author says that it will be found particularly
useful in hilly countries, where carriage is difficult, and sometimes
impracticable; and for farm buildings, which, as they must be made of
considerable extent, are usually very expensive, without yielding any
return.”</p>

<p><i>Definition.</i>&mdash;He introduces his subject thus:</p>

<p>“Pisé-building, in Rural Economy, the name of a method of building
with loamy or other earthy matters, which has long been practised with
great success, and in a very cheap manner, in some departments of
France, and which is now had recourse to with similar advantage in some
parts of this country. It has been described, delineated, and
recommended by Mr. H.&nbsp;Holland in the first volume of
<i>Communications to the Board of Agriculture</i>, and is to be managed
somewhat in the manner directed below.”</p>

<p class = "space">
At great length and with immense detail, the plant, the preliminaries,
and the process are each severally described.</p>

<p>The pith of the matter is sufficiently given by the following
extracts:</p>

<p><i>Shuttering.</i>&mdash;“For the construction of the mould, take
several planks, each 10 ft. long, of light wood, in order that the mould
may be easy to handle; deal is the best as being least liable to warp.
To prevent which the boards should be straight, sound, well seasoned,
and with as few knots as possible. Let them be ploughed and tongued, and
planed on both sides. Of these planks, fastened together with four
strong ledges on each side, the mould must be made, 2&nbsp;ft.
9&nbsp;in. in height; and two handles should be fixed to each side.</p>

<p>“All the boards and ledges here mentioned must be, after they are
planed, something more than 1&nbsp;in. thick.”</p>

<p><i>Rammer.</i>&mdash;“The instrument with which the earth is rammed
into the mould is a tool of the greatest consequence, on which the
firmness and durability, in short the perfection, of the work depends.
It is called a pisoir, or rammer; and though it may appear very easy to
make it, more difficulty will be found in the execution than is at first
apprehended. A&nbsp;better idea of its construction may be formed by
examining the Plate, in which it is delineated,
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>
than any words can convey. It should be made of hard wood, either ash,
oak, beech, walnut, etc., or what is preferable, the roots of either of
them.”</p>

<p><i>Method of Working.</i>&mdash;“Pisé contains all the best
principles of masonry, together with some rules peculiar to itself,
which are now to be explained.</p>

<p>“To begin with the foundation; this may be made of any kind of
masonry that is durable, and should be raised to the height of
2&nbsp;ft. above the ground; which is necessary to secure the walls from
the moisture of the earth, and the splashing of the rain, which will
drop from the eaves of the roof.<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id =
"tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> When these foundation walls are made level,
and 18 in. thick, mark upon them the distance at which the joists are to
be set, for receiving the moulds; those distances should be 3&nbsp;ft.
each from centre to centre. Each side of the mould being 10 ft. long,
will divide into three lengths of 3&nbsp;ft. each, and leave 6&nbsp;in.
at each end, which serve to lengthen the mould at the angles of the
house and are useful for many other purposes. After having set the
joists in their places, the masonry must be raised between them
6&nbsp;in. higher, that is, to a level with the joists; there will,
therefore, altogether be a base of 2½ ft., which in most cases will be
found more than sufficient to prevent the rain, frost, snow, or damp
from injuring the walls. Raise the mould immediately on this new
masonry, placing it over one of the angles of the wall.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
The Ramming</span></p>

<p>“A workman should be placed in each of the three divisions of the
mould, the best workman being placed at the angle. He is to direct the
work of the other two, and by occasionally applying a plumb-rule, to
take care that the mould does not swerve from its upright position. The
labourers who dig and prepare the earth must give it in small quantities
to the workmen in the mould, who, after having
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61" id = "page61"> </a>
spread it with their feet, begin to compress it with the rammer. They
must only receive at a time so much as will cover the bottom of the
mould to the thickness of 3&nbsp;or 4 in. The first strokes of the
rammer should be given close to the sides of the mould, but they must be
afterwards applied to every other part of the surface; the men should
then cross their strokes, so that the earth may be compressed in every
direction. Those who stand next to one another in the mould should
regulate their strokes so as to beat at the same time under the cord,
because that part cannot be got at without difficulty, and must be
struck obliquely; with this precaution, the whole will be equally
compressed. The man at the angle of the wall should beat carefully
against the head of the mould.</p>

<p>“Care must be taken that no fresh earth is received into the mould
till the first layer is well beaten, which may be ascertained by
striking it with a rammer; the stroke should leave hardly any print on
the place. They must proceed in this manner to ram in layer after layer,
till the whole mould is full. When this is done, the machine may be
taken to pieces, and the earth which is contained will remain firm and
upright, about 9&nbsp;ft. in length and 2½&nbsp;ft. in height. The mould
may then be replaced for another length, including 1&nbsp;in. of that
which has first been completed.</p>

<p>“The first course being thus completed, we proceed to the second; and
here it must be observed that in each successive course we must proceed
in a direction contrary to that of the preceding. It may easily be
conceived, that with this precaution the joints of the several lengths
will be inclined in opposite directions, which will contribute very much
to the firmness of the work. There is no reason to fear overcharging the
first course with the second, though but just laid; for three courses
may be laid without danger in one day.</p>

<p>“This description of the first two courses is equally applicable
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page62" id = "page62"> </a>
to all the others, and will enable any person to build a house, with no
other materials than earth, of whatever height and extent he
pleases.</p>

<p>“With respect to the gables, they may be made without any difficulty,
by merely making their inclination in the mould and working the earth
accordingly.”</p>


<h5><a name = "chapII_III" id = "chapII_III">§ III.</a>
The Theory and Science of Pisé</h5>

<p><i>The Value of Ramming.</i>&mdash;“Beating, or compression, is used
in many different sorts of work; the ancients employed it in making
their rough walls; the Italians employ it for the terraces which adorn
their houses; the Moors for all their walls; the Spaniards, the French,
and others for some of the floors of their apartments. The intent of the
ancient architects, when they recommended the beating of cement and
other compositions used in building, was to prevent them from shrinking
and cracking; and it is employed for the same purpose in walls which are
made of earth. The beater, by repeated strokes, forces out from the
earth the superfluous water which is contained and closely unites all
the particles together, by which means the natural attraction of these
particles is made powerful to operate, as it is by other natural causes
in the formation of stones. Hence arises the increasing strength and
astonishing durability which houses of this kind are found to
possess.”</p>

<p><i>An Experiment.</i>&mdash;“Upon beating a small portion of earth,
and weighing it immediately afterwards, it was found to weigh 39½ lb.
Fifteen days after, it had lost 4¼ lb. In the space of another fifteen
days it lost but 1 lb.; and in fifteen days after that its weight
diminished only ½ lb. In the space of about forty-five days the moisture
was completely evaporated, and its weight was diminished about
one-eighth; consequently only one-eighth of the whole mass was occupied
by moisture, and this small proportion cannot at all affect the solidity
and consistency
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page63" id = "page63"> </a>
of the earth so treated. This experiment is also sufficient to show the
difference between this kind of building and that vulgar kind called in
England ‘mud-walling.’”</p>

<p><i>Rate of Work.</i>&mdash;“In one single day three courses of about
3&nbsp;ft. each may be laid one over the other; so that a wall of earth
of about 8&nbsp;or 9 ft., or one story high, may be safely raised in one
day. Experience has proved that as soon as the builders have raised
their walls to a proper height for flooring, the heaviest beams and
rafters may without danger be placed on the walls thus newly made; and
that the thickest timber of a roof may be laid on the gables of pisé the
very instant they are completed.”</p>


<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Suitable Soils</span></p>

<h6>ON EARTH PROPER FOR BUILDING</h6>

<p><i>Suitable Soils.</i>&mdash;“1st. All earths in general are fit for
that use, when they have not the lightness of poor lands nor the
stiffness of clay.</p>

<p>“2ndly. All earths fit for vegetation.</p>

<p>“3rdly. Brick-earths; but these, if they are used alone, are apt to
crack, owing to the quantity of moisture which they contain. This,
however, does not hinder persons who understand the business from using
them to a good purpose.</p>

<p>“4thly. Strong earths, with a mixture of small gravel, which for that
reason cannot serve for making either bricks, tiles, or pottery. These
gravelly earths are very useful, and the best pisé is made of them.”</p>

<p><i>Soil Tests.</i>&mdash;“The following appearances indicate that the
earth in which they are found is fit for building: when a pickaxe,
spade, or plough brings up large lumps of earth at a time; when arable
lands lies in clods or lumps; when field-mice have made themselves
subterraneous passages in the earth; all these are favourable signs.
When the roads of a village, having been worn away by the water
continually running through them, are lower than the other lands, and
the sides of those roads support themselves
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<a name = "page64" id = "page64"> </a>
almost upright, it is a sure mark that pisé may be executed in that
village. One may also discover the fitness of the soil by trying to
break with one’s fingers the little clods of earth in the roads, and
finding a difficulty in doing it; or by observing the ruts of the road,
in which the cart-wheels make a sort of pisé by their pressure; whenever
there are deep ruts on a road, one may be sure of finding abundance of
proper earth.</p>

<p>“Proper earth is found at the bottom of the slopes of low lands that
are cultivated, because every year the rain brings down the fat or good
earth. It is frequently found on the banks of the river, but above all,
it is found at the foot of hills, and on all cultivated lands which have
much slope. In digging trenches and cellars for building, it generally
happens that what comes out of them is fit for the purpose.”</p>


<h6>ON THE MIXTURE OF EARTHS</h6>

<p><i>Soil Blending.</i>&mdash;“As it may sometimes happen that earth of
a proper quality is not to be found on the spot where it is intended to
build, it becomes of importance to attend to the method of mixing
earths; for though the earth which is near at hand may not of itself be
proper, it is very probable that it may be rendered so by the mixture of
a small quantity of another earth fetched from a distance. The principle
on which a mixture must be made is very simple; strong earths must be
tempered with light; those in which clay predominates, with others that
are composed more of chalk and sand; and those of a rich, glutinous
substance, with others of a poor and barren nature. The degree in which
these qualities of the earths prevail must determine the proportions of
the mixture; which it is impossible here to point out for every
particular case, but which may be learnt by a little practice. Some easy
methods will be described, by which any one may make a trial of the
qualities of his earth.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page65" id = "page65"> </a>
<p>“It will not be amiss to mix with the earth some small pebbles,
gravel, rubbish of mortar, or in short any small mineral substances; but
none of the animal or vegetable kind must be admitted.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a> Such hard substances
bind the earth firmly between them, and being pressed and pressing in
all directions, contribute very much to the solidity of the whole; so
that well-worked earth, in which there is a mixture of gravel, becomes
so hard at the end of two years that a chisel must be used to break it,
as if it was freestone.”</p>


<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Experiments</span></p>

<h6>EXPERIMENTS TO ASCERTAIN THE QUALITIES OF ANY EARTH</h6>

<p><i>Trial by Experiment.</i>&mdash;“Take a small wooden tub or pail,
without a bottom, dig a hole in the ground of a court or garden, and at
the bottom of that hole fix a piece of stone, flat and level; place your
tub upon the stone, fill around it the earth that has been dug out to
make the hole, and ram it well, that the tub may be enclosed, to prevent
its bursting. Then ram into the tub the earth you mean to try; putting
in, at each time, about the thickness of three or four fingers’
breadths: when this is well rammed, add as much more, and ram it in the
same manner, and so the third and fourth, etc., till the earth is raised
above the brim. This superfluous earth must be scraped off extremely
smooth, and rendered as even as the under-part will be, which lies on
the stone. Loosen with a spade the earth around the tub, and you will
then be able to take it out, and with it the compressed earth that it
contains; then turn the tub upside down, and if it is wider at the top
than at the bottom, as such vessels usually are, the pisé will
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<a name = "page66" id = "page66"> </a>
easily come out, but if it should happen to stick, let it dry in the air
about twenty-four hours, and you will then find that the earth is loose
enough to fall out of itself. You must be careful to cover this lump of
pisé with a little board; for though a shower of rain, falling in an
oblique direction, will not injure it, yet it may be a little damaged if
the rain falls perpendicularly, and especially if it remains upon it.
Leave the lump exposed to the air, only covered with a board or flat
stone, and if it continues without cracking or crumbling, and increases
daily in density and compactness as its natural moisture decreases, you
may be sure that the earth is fit for building. But you must remember
that it is necessary that the earth employed should be taken from a
little below the surface of the ground, in order that it may be neither
too dry nor too wet; it must be observed also that if the earth is not
well pressed around the outside of the tub before it is filled, though
the hoops were of iron, they would burst, so great is the pressure of
the beaten earth against the mould, of whatever size it
may&nbsp;be.”</p>

<p><i>The Earth-ball Test&mdash;An Experiment which may be made at any
time.</i>&mdash;“Every person in walking on his ground may make little
balls of earth and press them as tight as he can between his hands. If
he brings them home and puts marks on them, he will by that means know
the quality of every piece of land, and also be a judge of the mixture
it will be necessary to make.”</p>


<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Preparation of the Earth</span></p>

<h6>ON THE PREPARATION OF THE EARTH FOR BUILDING</h6>

<p><i>Soil Preparation.</i>&mdash;“All the operations of this art are
very simple and easy; there is nothing to be done but to dig up the
earth with a pickaxe, break the clods with a shovel, so as to divide it
well, and then lay it in a heap, which is very necessary, because as the
labourers throw it on that heap, the lumps of earth and large stones
roll to the bottom, where another man may break them or draw them away
with a
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67" id = "page67"> </a>
rake. I&nbsp;must observe that there should be an interval of about an
inch and a quarter between the teeth of the rake, that the stones and
pebbles of the size of a walnut, or something more, may escape, and that
it may draw off only the largest. If the earth that has been dug has not
the proper quality, which is seldom the case, and it is necessary to
fetch some better from a distance, then the mixture must be made in this
manner: one man must throw one shovelful of the best sort, while the
others throw five or six of the inferior sort on the heap, and so more
or less according to the proportions which have been previously
ascertained.”</p>

<p><i>Rain.</i>&mdash;“No more earth should be prepared than the men can
work in one day, or a little more, that they may not be in want; but if
rain is expected, you must have at hand either planks, mats, or old
cloths to lay over the heap of earth, so that the rain may not wet it;
and then as soon as the rain is over, the men may resume their work,
which, without this precaution, must be delayed; for it must be
remembered that the earth cannot be used when it is either too dry or
too wet, and therefore if the rain should wet it after it has been
prepared, the men will be obliged to wait till it has recovered its
proper consistency&mdash;a delay which would be equally disadvantageous
to them and their employer. When the earth has been soaked by rain,
instead of suffering compression, it becomes mud in the mould; even
though it be but a little too moist, it cannot be worked; it swells
under the blows of the rammer, and a stroke in one place makes it rise
in another. When this is the case, it is better to stop the work, for
the men find so much difficulty that it is not worth while to proceed.
But there is not the same necessity of discontinuing the work when the
earth is too dry, for it is easy to give it the necessary degree of
moisture; in such a case it should be sprinkled with a watering-pot, and
afterwards well mixed up together; it will then be fit for use.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<a name = "page68" id = "page68"> </a>
<p><i>Organic Matter.</i>&mdash;“It has already been observed that no
vegetable substances should be left in the earth; therefore in digging,
as well as in laying the earth in a heap, great care must be taken to
pick out every bit of root, great and small, all sprigs and herbs, all
bits of hay and straw, chips or shavings of woods, and in general
everything that can rot or suffer a change in the earth.”</p>


<h6>ON THE BOND TIMBER TO BE USED IN BUILDINGS OF PISÉ</h6>

<p><i>Corners.</i>&mdash;“To make good walls, it is not sufficient that
the earth be well beaten, we must also learn to unite them well
together. Here the binders cost very little; they consist only of thin
pieces of wood, a&nbsp;few cramps and nails, and these are sufficient to
give the greatest stability to buildings of pisé.”</p>

<p>Having gone on to explain that the angles of the building are formed
by the successive courses alternately crossing one another on the corner
like the alternating “long and short” quoins in a stone building, our
authority proceeds to describe how rough boards are laid between the
courses of pisé so as to cross at the corner and so, entirely encased in
tightly compressed earth, they form effective ties.</p>

<p>“This board must be rough, as the sawyers have left it, 5&nbsp;or
6&nbsp;ft. long, something less than 1&nbsp;in. thick, and in breadth
about 8, 9&nbsp;or 10 in., so that there may remain on each side
4&nbsp;or 5 in. of earth, if the wall is 18 in. thick; by this means the
board will be entirely concealed in the body of the wall. When thus
placed neither the air nor damp can reach it, and of course there is no
danger of its rotting. This has been often proved by experience, as in
taking down old houses of pisé such boards have always been found <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘prefectly’">perfectly</ins>sound,
and many that had not even lost the
colour of new wood. It is easy to conceive how much this board, from the
pressure of the work raised above it, will help to bind together the two
lengths of wall and to strengthen the angle.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page69" id = "page69"> </a>
<p><i>Bonders.</i>&mdash;“It is useful (particularly when the earth is
not of a very good quality) to put ends of planks into the pisé after it
has been rammed about half the height of the mould. These ends of planks
should only be 10 or 11 in. long, to leave as before a few inches of
earth on each side of the wall, if it is 18 in. thick; they should be
laid crosswise (as&nbsp;the plank before mentioned is laid lengthwise)
over the whole course, at the distance of about 2&nbsp;ft. from one
another, and will serve to equalise the pressure of the upper parts of
the works on the lower course of the pisé.</p>

<p>“The boards above mentioned need only be placed at the angles of the
exterior wall, and in those parts where the courses of the partition
walls join to those of the exterior wall, the same directions that have
here been given for the second course must be observed at each
succeeding course, up to the roof. By these means the reader will
perceive that an innumerable quantity of holders or bondings will be
formed, which sometimes draw to the right, sometimes to the left of the
angles, and which powerfully unite the front walls with those of the
partitions; the several parts deriving mutual support from one another,
and the whole being rendered compact and solid.”</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
The Strength of Pisé</span></p>

<p><i>Strength.</i>&mdash;“Hence these houses, made of earth alone, are
able to resist the violence of the highest winds, storms and tempests.
The height that is intended to be given to each story being known,
boards of 3&nbsp;or 4 ft. in length should be placed beforehand in the
pisé, in those places where the beams are to be fixed, and as soon as
the mould no longer occupies that place, the beams may be laid on,
though the pisé be fresh made; little slips of wood, or boards, may be
introduced under them, in order to fix them level. The beams thus fixed
for each story, the pisé may be continued as high as the place on which
you intend to erect the roof.”</p>


<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page70" id = "page70"> </a>
<h6>ON THE TIME AND LABOUR NECESSARY IN BUILDING A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF
PISÉ</h6>

<p><i>Speed of Building.</i>&mdash;“Besides the advantages of strength
and cheapness, this method of building possesses that of speed in the
execution. That the reader may know the time that is required for
building a house, or an enclosure, he need only be told that a mason
used to the work can, with the help of his labourer, when the earth lies
near, build in one day 6&nbsp;ft. square of the pisé.”</p>

<p><i>Rendering.</i>&mdash;“To prepare the walls for plastering, indent
them with the point of the hammer, or hatchet, without being afraid of
spoiling the surface left by the mould; all those little dents must be
made as close as possible to each other, and cut in from top to bottom,
so that every hole may have a little rest in the inferior part, which
will serve to retain and support the plaster.</p>

<p>“If you happen to lay the plaster over them before the dampness is
entirely gone, you must expect that the sweat of the walls will cast off
the plaster.”</p>

<p>The wall surface having been duly hammer-chipped, the work must be
scoured with a stiff brush to remove all loose earth and dust, and to
finally prepare it for rough-casting. Rough-cast consists of a small
quantity of mortar, diluted with water in a tub, to which a trowel of
pure lime is added, so as to make it about the thickness of cream.</p>

<p>One workman and his labourers are sufficient; the workman on the
scaffold sprinkles with a brush the wall he has indented, swept, and
prepared; after that he dips another brush, made of bits of reed, box,
etc., into the tub which contains the rough-cast, and throws with this
brush the rough-cast against the wall.</p>

<p>“Rough-cast, which is attended with so little trouble and expense, is
notwithstanding the best cover that can be made for pisé walls, and for
all other constructions; it contributes to preserve the buildings. It is
the peculiar
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
advantage of these buildings that all the materials they require are
cheap, and all the workmanship simple and easy.”</p>

<p><i>Local Testimony.</i>&mdash;At the end of the article just
summarised, an instructive letter from a former rector of St. John’s, La
Rochelle, is quoted:</p>

<p>“<span class = "smallcaps">Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;“My having been an inhabitant for some time of the town
of Montbrison, capital of the Forets, enables me to give you some
information concerning the mode of building houses with earth, etc.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
A Pisé Church</span></p>

<p><i>A Pisé Church.</i>&mdash;“The church was the most remarkable in
this style of building; it is about 80 ft. long, 40 ft. broad, and 50
ft. high; the walls built in pisé, 18 in. thick, and crépé, or
rough-cast on the outside, with lime and sand. Soon after my arrival,
the church, by some accident, was destroyed by fire, and remained
unroofed for about a twelvemonth, exposed to rains and frost. As it was
suspected that the walls had sustained much damage, either by fire or
the inclemency of the season, and might fall down, it was determined to
throw them down partially, and leave only the lower parts standing; but
even this was not done without much difficulty, such was the firmness
and hardness these walls had acquired, the church having stood above
eighty years; and all the repairs required were only to give it on the
outside, every twelve or fifteen years, a&nbsp;new coating of
rough-cast.</p>

<p>“A house for a single family is generally finished in about a
fortnight. The following is the method I have seen them practise.”</p>

<p><i>Building Procedure.</i>&mdash;“The earth is pounded as much as
possible, in order to crumble any stones therein; clay is added thereto
in a small quantity, about one-eighth part. It is all beaten and mixed
up together by repeated blows with a mallet about 10 in. broad, and 10
or 15 in. long, and 2&nbsp;in. thick. The earth being thus prepared, and
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>
slightly wetted, the foundation of the house is dug for; this is laid
with stone, and when it is about 1&nbsp;ft. high above the surface of
the ground, planks are arranged on each side, which are filled with
earth intended for the wall; this is called Pisé in the dialect of the
country. It is strongly beaten; and this method is continued
successively all round the building. The walls have more or less
thickness according to the fancy of the owner; I&nbsp;have seen them
6&nbsp;in. and 18 in. thick. If several stories are intended in such
erections, they do not fail to place beams to support the floors before
they build higher. Of such buildings I never saw any consisting of more
than three floors at most; generally they have but two. When the
building is thus finished, it is left for some months to dry; then such
as wish to make the building more solid and durable, give it a
rough-cast coating on the outside with lime and sand. This is what I
have observed during a residence of three years in the town of
Montbrison. I&nbsp;should be happy if this detail should afford the
slightest information to the generous nation which has received us with
so much goodness.</p>

“<span class = "smallcaps">Jaucour</span>.”</p>

<p><i>The Virtues of Pisé.</i>&mdash;“Such is the method of building
which has been practised in the Lyonnese for many centuries. Houses so
built are strong, healthy, and very cheap, they will last a great length
of time, for the French author says he had pulled down some of them
which, from the title-deeds in the possession of the proprietors,
appeared to be 165 years old, though they had been ill kept in repair.
The rich traders of Lyons have no other way of building their
country-houses. An outside covering of painting in fresco, which is
attended with very little expense, conceals from the eye of the
spectator the nature of the building, and is a handsome ornament to the
house.
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73" id = "page73"> </a>
That method of painting has more freshness and brilliancy than any
other, because water does not impair the colours. No size, oil, or
expense is required, manual labour is almost all it costs, either to the
rich or poor. Any person may make his house look as splendid as he
pleases, for a few pence laid out in red or yellow ochre, or in other
mineral colours.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“</ins>Strangers
who have sailed upon the Rhône probably never
suspected that those beautiful houses, which they saw rising on the
hills around them, were built of nothing but earth, nay, many persons
have dwelt for a considerable time in such houses without ever being
aware of their singular construction. Farmers in that country generally
have them simply white-washed, but others, who have a greater taste for
ornament, add pilasters, window-cases, panels, and decorations of
various kinds.</p>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“</ins>There
is every reason for introducing this method of building into all parts
of the kingdom; whether we consider the honour of the nation as
concerned in the neatness of its villages, the great saving of wood
which it will occasion, and the consequent security from fire, or the
health of the inhabitants, to which it will greatly contribute, as such
houses are never liable to the extremes of heat or cold. It is attended
with many other circumstances that are advantageous to the State as well
as to individuals. It saves both time and labour in building, and the
houses may be inhabited almost immediately after they are finished; for
which latter purpose, the holes made for the joists should not be closed
up directly, as the air, if suffered to circulate through them, will dry
the walls more speedily.”</p>

Indian and Colonial Practice</h5>

<p><i>A Manual on Earthwork</i>, edited by Colonel Maclagan, R.E., gives
much interesting information as to Pisé-building and a number of
valuable hints:</p>

<p><i>Shutter-ties.</i>&mdash;“Cross pieces, as the work proceeds,
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page74" id = "page74"> </a>
become so firmly embedded in the wall, that there is great difficulty in
extracting them, to remedy which iron bars have been substituted. Even
these thin iron bars become so tightly jammed when surrounded by the
compact pisé earth, that much labour and risk of injury to the work is
incurred in extricating them, and the expedient of setting them in a bed
of sand has been successfully resorted to. They are then drawn out with
care, the sand also is removed, and the holes which they leave are
subsequently filled with the same earth of which the wall is made, and
rammed hard.</p>

<p>“The heads of the opposite uprights are held together by ropes, but
in practice in this country<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6"
href = "#note6">6</a> it has been found that, under the immense pressure
exerted upon the plank sides by the earth firmly rammed in the interior,
the ropes are so liable to stretch, and to break, that it is advisable
to use iron rods or bars in this position also. When ropes are used, the
distance between the side planks is measured by gauge rods, and the
ropes tightened when requisite to preserve the proper breadth of wall.
The use of iron connecting rods renders this unnecessary.”</p>

<p><i>Soil.</i>&mdash;“Soil of a medium quality, that is neither very
stiff nor very sandy, is considered best adapted for pisé. It may be
said that that which would make good bricks will answer well for this
description of work.</p>

<p>“When the earth is very dry, a sprinkling of water will be
necessary.”</p>

<p><i>Foundations.</i>&mdash;“It is usual to begin the work upon a
foundation of brick or masonry; but there seems to be no reason why the
pisé might not be used from the commencement, even for foundations under
ground; being carefully guarded from all chance of injury by running
water.”</p>

<p><i>The Building.</i>&mdash;“The casing being prepared and erected,
and the upper surface of the old work, when above the first stage, being
sprinkled with water, the earth, well mixed and slightly moistened, is
thrown in, and spread in thin
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page75" id = "page75"> </a>
layers of 4&nbsp;or 5 in. These should, when rammed, be reduced to
one-half their original thickness. The rammers should be of hard wood
and very smooth. The successive layers are similarly treated, and thus
the work proceeds until the top of the casing is reached. The ends of
each portion should be finished with a slope, to which will be joined
the portion next to be added longitudinally. These joinings should not,
in the successive courses, be above those of the lower stage, but as in
masonry and brickwork, should ‘break joint.’ The seams are all
distinctly perceptible when the work is complete.”</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Plastering</span></p>

<p><i>Plastering.</i>&mdash;“The wall may have a coating of plaster, or
the surface may be simply smoothed and dressed with a shovel, or similar
implement. When it is to be plastered, it is necessary that the wall
should first be thoroughly dry. If dry only externally whilst damp
within, it has been found that the moisture is apt subsequently to
attack the plaster and cause it to fall off in flakes. Without plaster,
good Pisé work is found successfully to withstand exposure to the
weather, and after the lapse of many years to be so compact and hard as
to be picked down with difficulty.”</p>

<p><i>Protection.</i>&mdash;“Where the wall is not that of a roofed
building, it should be provided with a coping, having a good projection
to protect it from rain.”</p>

<p><i>Rods versus Bars.</i>&mdash;“The substitution of iron connecting
bars for the wooden ones has been mentioned above. The evils of the
wooden arrangement were found to be: the starting of the wedges, the
fracture of the tenons, the tight jamming of the bars in the wall, and
the injury to the walls and to the bars themselves from the force
requisite to be applied for extracting them. The lower iron connecting
bars are made 3½ in. by ½&nbsp;in.; the upper, 1&nbsp;in. by ⅓ or
¼&nbsp;in. each, having holes ½&nbsp;in. by ¼&nbsp;in., with
corresponding pins.</p>

<p>“The mode of setting the bars and arranging the work on each
successive elevation of the casing is to cut on the
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
surface of the completed part of the wall a groove 1&nbsp;in. wider than
the bar, filling it in, after placing the bar, with sand, to the level
of the wall’s surface. The side boarding being set up, the vacant space
left along the bevelled edge of the previous course is filled up with
moist clay to retain the first layer of the new course. The end pieces
are secured by iron bars or rods, with screws and nuts.”<a class = "tag"

<p><i>Ramming.</i>&mdash;“Gentle and quick ramming has been found most
effectual.”</p>


<h6 class = "ital">
Report on the Pisé-work executed at the Etah Jail during 1867-8. By Mr.
H.&nbsp;Sprenger, Assistant Engineer</h6>

<p>“The boxes in which the pisé-work at the Etah Jail is being executed
consist of two wooden frames 10 ft. long and 2½ ft. broad, made of
planks, which are nailed on to stout battens. They are held together by
four pairs of posts 3&nbsp;in. by 3&nbsp;in., which are connected above
and below with tie-bars of flat iron 1½ in. by ¼ in. The tie-bars have
at each end a certain number of ½ in. holes punched in them to receive
pins for the purpose of preventing the posts from slipping off. By
changing the pins, walls of any given dimension can be obtained, wedges
of hard wood, with longitudinal slots, are introduced between the posts
and the pins, to adjust the breadth of the boxes to a standard gauge.
After the boxes are fixed and adjusted, they are secured in their
position by ropes passing over them, and tied to stakes on each side.
Any deflection from the vertical should be corrected at the commencement
of the work, as it is impossible to alter the position of a box after it
is half full. Any earth which is suitable for brick-making will do for
pisé-work. On being dug out it is passed through
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
a screen with ½-in. meshes, and thrown into the boxes in even layers of
6&nbsp;in. in depth.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
The Right Quantity of Water</span></p>

<p>“Generally fresh earth contains sufficient moisture to ensure good
consolidation; but if it is found that it jumps up under the rammers, it
should, on being thrown into the boxes, be sprinkled with a little water
out of a tin can with a rose. The watering should be as uniform as
possible, as if it is applied unequally it will liquefy the earth, which
will commence oozing out under the rammers. Pisé-work executed with too
much water is worse than if done with dry earth, as, on account of the
elasticity of the wet earth, the effect of the ramming is deadened, and
the earth remains unconsolidated. The men should be prohibited to keep
time in ramming, as it causes vibration, which is injurious to the
stability of the wall. On working over a lower course, it is as well to
let the lower tie-bars about 4&nbsp;in. into the same to give the boxes
a firm hold on the old work, thereby the joints become imperceptible,
and the upper edge of the lower course is prevented from chipping
off.</p>

<p>“The implements used are three different kinds of rammers. The earth
is first beaten down with a V-shaped rammer, and then surfaced with one
with a flat bottom. The sides of the boxes are consolidated with a
spade-shaped rammer. When commencing the pisé-work at Etah, considerable
difficulty was experienced in extricating the lower tie-bars. These
were, therefore, supplied with holes 3&nbsp;in. apart throughout their
whole length. A&nbsp;pin was inserted, against which a crow-bar with a
long slot and well bent at the end was made to work. An equal pressure
could thereby be exerted against the tie-bars; they were thus extracted
with great facility without injuring them or the face of the wall, which
was not the case formerly.”</p>

<p>“The work at Etah has generally been concluded in the
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page78" id = "page78"> </a>
following manner: In the morning the boxes were taken down, and again
put up and filled during the day; they were left during the night, so
that the earth might detach itself from the sides. It is not advisable
to allow a course to dry thoroughly, as the upper one will not bind well
into it, but probably show a crack. If the earth is well rammed, and
only the proper quantity of moisture admitted, a&nbsp;second course can
be commenced immediately.”</p>

“Pisé de Terre Buildings</h6>

<p>“<i>The Spectator</i> took this matter up some two years ago and
wrote as follows:</p>

<p>“‘Various schemes of land settlement are in the
air.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All of them must, however, be concerned with
cheap buildings. That is a <i>sine qua
non</i>.’&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“The material used for the walls at Empandeni is one-third sand,
one-third ant-heap, and one-third soil, all pulverised and put through a
sieve. Water is then added. The mixture must be neither too wet nor too
dry, just sufficiently damp to bind; a&nbsp;good indication of the
correct consistency being that when squeezed hard by the hand it shows a
tendency to bind. Sufficient of the loose mixture is thrown into the
form to fill it to a depth of about 3&nbsp;in., and this is thoroughly
rammed before the next layer is put in. Most thorough ramming is
essential. When the frame is rammed full, it is taken apart and shifted
along to make another section and so on until the first layer is
complete. The first layer is, as a rule, sufficiently dry to permit the
starting of the next about three hours after laying. Door and window
frames are put in as the work proceeds, and must be well braced while
ramming. In the top layer hoop iron or fencing wire is let in for
fastening down the wall plates. Arsenite of soda or Atlas Compound
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page79" id = "page79"> </a>
is used in the first layer or two to keep out white ants. The floor can
be made of timber, cement concrete, or rammed earth, and the roof
thatched or covered with corrugated iron as is most convenient.</p>

<p>“The following Pisé de terre buildings have been erected at
Empandeni:</p>

<p>“A large schoolroom 75 ft. by 28 ft. by 12 ft. high, walls 14 in.
thick; seven boys’ dormitories, each 30 ft. by 20 ft. by 12 ft.; twelve
single-room houses, each 16 ft. by 12 ft.; six fowl houses, each 20 ft.
by 10 ft.; a&nbsp;large fowl house 250 ft. long, front walls 7&nbsp;ft.
and back walls 5&nbsp;ft. high. This building is divided into fifteen
compartments.</p>

<p>“From the foregoing description it is quite evident that cheap and
efficient buildings of this nature can be erected at a very low
cost.</p>

<p>“On a farm it is not necessary to employ any skilled labour, as the
doors and windows can be purchased ready-made, and the frame-work,
clamps, etc., put together by the farmer himself. For a roof of thatch
all the necessary material, except iron ridging, if this is used, can as
a rule be procured on the farm.</p>

<p>“Should a cement concrete floor, which is cheaper than a wood one, be
desired, there would be an extra expenditure for cement, the amount
required being about two bags per twelve square yards. Such a floor
should be laid before the walls of the building are commenced, and it is
essential that the site is thoroughly well rammed and consolidated,
particularly below where walls will come, before laying the concrete, to
prevent cracks developing through settlement. The concrete raft should
be carried at least 6&nbsp;in. beyond the outside walls of the building,
and if the work is properly done, a&nbsp;special ant-course will be
unnecessary. The concrete can be left rough below the walls to give a
bond, and it might be advisable to lay some pieces of hoop iron in it
which would be left projecting to be bedded into the walls.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<a name = "page80" id = "page80"> </a>
<p>“Another good type of floor would probably be that suggested in
<i>The Spectator</i>, viz. road material laid down and tarred in the
same manner as roads are now made in many places.</p>

<p>“A number of rooms and houses have been erected on the Globe and
Phœnix Mine on much the same principle as Pisé de terre buildings, but
the system developed there is different as regards the mixture, which
consists of two parts ant-heap or ordinary dagga which must not be too
sandy, and three parts ashes or clinker sieved free from fine dust.</p>

<p>“A very full description of the method employed on this mine was
forwarded by the courtesy of the Manager to the Committee, and it is
interesting to note from this that the walls are made waterproof by
first making them smooth with dagga plaster, then, when quite dry,
giving one good coat of boiling hot tar. A&nbsp;coat of limewash is
applied three days later. That this is effective is well evidenced by
the fact that the buildings erected have successfully withstood our last
abnormally heavy rainy season.</p>

<p>“The Globe and Phœnix system is the result of a number of experiments
carried out on that mine. Their mixture, which is stated to be
ant-proof, contains more moisture than Pisé de terre, and each course is
reinforced with old wire rope, or other suitable scrap. The material is
left in a heap for one or two days before being used.</p>

<p>“Circular huts have been built on the mine of the same material, the
forms being made of two rings of corrugated iron in three or more
sections joined up with cleats at the end laps and held in position with
cross bolts and distance pieces. The inner ring is 9&nbsp;in. less
radius than the outer one.”</p>

Pisé Buildings for Settlers</span></p>

<h6 class = "ital">
Extracts from a paper on Pisé in the “Farmers’ Handbook,” issued by the
Department of Agriculture, New South Wales, 1911</h6>

<p><ins class = "correction" title = "text has single quote">“Pisé</ins>
is a material readily obtainable by the settler,
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81" id = "page81"> </a>
of which cheap and durable buildings can be easily and substantially
erected.</p>

<p>“For the construction of pastoral or agricultural buildings,
especially in districts remote from railways, or from towns in which
other building materials are cheap or easily procurable, pisé is
particularly well adapted. In the country earth is plentiful and readily
obtainable; in the city or town such is not the case, and this fact,
combined with the very bulky nature of the material, prohibits its use
in such centres of population.</p>

<p>“To the selector or settler, who, like many of our successful
pioneers, is not burdened with a superfluity of hard cash, but who
possesses an abundant capital of energy, combined with a certain amount
of handiness, pisé has an additional advantage (which it shares with
slabs, wattle and daub, etc.) over most other building materials, in
that it affords him an opportunity of erecting his homesteading largely
as the result of his own labour.</p>

<p>“As a building material, pisé is infinitely superior and more durable
than slabs, galvanised iron, or weather-boards. In fact it is
questionable whether it is not more suitable for our climate, and
therefore to be preferred to brickwork; for pisé buildings, properly
protected and finished, are quite as durable and much cooler than
buildings constructed with solid brick walls. This statement may be
questioned by some whose knowledge of pisé is limited to buildings so
badly planned that the very elementary principles of building
construction have been neglected. This neglect, which is all too common,
makes things bad enough, but when to it is added, as is sometimes the
case, indifferent workmanship, combined with the use of unsuitable
material, the result does not call for admiration, and it is not
surprising that a bad impression is created. With no other knowledge of
pisé it is only natural to condemn it because of such specimens, but
under similar circumstances other better-known
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82" id = "page82"> </a>
building materials of proved excellence would also be condemned.
Brickwork would just as readily be condemned if its building qualities
had to be estimated by the appearance presented by a brick building
which had been constructed of badly-burnt bricks laid by unskilful
tradesmen on an imperfectly thought-out plan. Just as with other
building materials, the possibilities of this material can only be
judged by an examination of properly planned and constructed examples of
the pisé-builder’s art. Such are found here and there throughout the
country, pleasing to look at, affording comfort and satisfaction to
their owners. A&nbsp;properly constructed pisé building can be finished
to suit the taste of the most fastidious. Even without plaster the walls
can be ‘floated’ down and a ‘skin’ obtained on them which, when
limewashed, resembles stonework. When plastered inside and out they
possess the advantages of a stone house, and are erected at a fraction
of the cost.</p>

<p>“Some idea may be formed of the durability of pisé by the fact that
there is a stable built of pisé which has been in constant use for over
sixty years, and which at the present time is in good order. The good
condition of this stable is the more surprising because the external
walls are unprotected from the weather, and it is generally recognised
that pisé-work, especially if unplastered, should be protected from the
direct action of rain. Pisé buildings are said to have a life of a
century and a half.</p>

<p>“The stability of pisé buildings is beyond question, as is proved by
the following instance:&mdash;At Lambrigg, a&nbsp;second-story brick
building, with 14-in. walls, and containing ten rooms, is built upon a
lower story of pisé. The bricklayer who had the contract for erecting
the brick portion of the house refused, as it was built upon pisé, to
guarantee his work. Some time after the completion of the house he
visited it, and after a thorough examination of the building, declared
that it was the most substantial brick
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<a name = "page83" id = "page83"> </a>
house in the district, as it had not a crack in it, a&nbsp;feature which
was somewhat unusual in that locality. Another case bearing on the same
subject is that of a residence at Temora. When this building was being
constructed the workmen omitted to leave holes for the bolts which were
to secure the verandah plates to the walls, as it was thought these
could readily be bored out afterwards with an auger. On attempting to
bore out these holes on the completion of the building, and when the
pisé-work had become drier, the operation of boring proved so difficult
as to be practically impossible, and had to be abandoned.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Builders’ Aversions</span></p>

<p>“The merits of pisé-work have been recognised in France, India,
Mexico, and California for years past, and seeing its equal suitability
for our climate, it is surprising that these merits have not led to its
being more extensively used. The principal reason for this seems to be
because our builders are averse to undertaking this class of work, and
in consequence the bulk of it is placed in the hands of untrained men,
who, whilst quite fitted to carry out the pisé-work, are not competent
to undertake the other constructive work of a building. However, they do
not hesitate to do this, as well as to undertake the more important work
(though unrecognised as being&nbsp;so) of planning out the building. The
result is in most cases an improperly planned and defectively
constructed building, which appeals to no one, but has a tendency to
bring pisé into disrepute.</p>

<p>“The reason for a builder’s unwillingness to undertake pisé-work is
not far to seek. For the successful carrying out of his work a builder
relies upon skilled tradesmen; our tradesmen are trained in cities and
towns, and as pisé is not a suitable material for such places, tradesmen
do not become familiar with it. A&nbsp;good builder with a reputation to
lose shrinks from placing that reputation at the mercy of a
pisé-builder, who is not recognised as a tradesman, and in whom, in
consequence of this, a&nbsp;builder is likely to have little or no
confidence.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
<p>“The actual erection of pisé-work presents so little difficulty that
it can be done by any one who has sufficient strength to shovel earth
and wield a rammer, provided he will exercise care to see that the
moulds or boxes into which the earth is shovelled are kept plumb and in
straight lines. The average settler, even with no previous knowledge of
pisé-work or building construction, need have no hesitation in
undertaking the pisé-work of his own buildings if he works to a
well-thought-out plan drawn up by somebody competent to do&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>“The necessity of having a plan prepared by some one who understands
the principles and requirements of simple building construction, before
undertaking the erection of any building, cannot be too strongly
emphasised. This great need, which is often overlooked by the settler,
cannot be economically dispensed with. The securing of a properly
prepared plan is of the greatest value towards obtaining a building of
the maximum strength and durability, combined with the best appearance
and greatest convenience, for the least cost. Even when a settler
undertakes the pisé-work of his own building, it will only be in rare
instances that he will not have the advantage of trained supervision
during its erection. The services of a tradesman will invariably be
found necessary to make doors and window-frames, construct the roof,
etc. This workman can be engaged when the building is started, and
whilst preparing the timbers of the roof, in readiness for the time when
they will be required on the completion of the pisé-work, can supervise
the fixing of the door and window frames, and see they are set
correctly, and in their proper places.</p>

<p>“Pisé walls are constructed in sections, the extent of which is
regulated by the supply of casings available.</p>

<p>“Into the moulds formed by the boxes the earth is shovelled in layers
of 4&nbsp;or 5 in., and then rammed until thoroughly solid before
another layer is put in. On the completion of the section, <i>i.e.</i>
when the mould is full and
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
well rammed, the keys or pins are knocked out of the ‘bolts,’ and the
‘boxes’ taken apart and erected on another portion of the building. The
top of that portion of the pisé-work on which it is proposed to erect
another section should be well moistened and covered with wet bags some
hours before the mould is formed. The bottom of the mould should overlap
the top of the pisé-work by about 6&nbsp;in. After the ‘boxes’ are put
together, the top layer of pisé should be loosened with a pick so as to
form a bond with the section about to be built, and if this section
adjoins one already built, the ends of the latter should be bevelled off
so as not to form a straight joint.</p>

<p>“Material which is too sandy will fret away, and one containing clay
will crack when dry. Soils containing these defects should be avoided.
There is, however, such a wide range of soils which are suitable that a
holding of any size on which suitable soils cannot be found will be the
exception. It is possible to remedy the defects found in one soil by
mixing it with another soil, but very rarely will such a course be
necessary.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Number of Men Required</span></p>

<p>“The plant required will depend upon the number of men to be
employed. Three is the least number that can be economically
employed&mdash;two attending to the boxes and ramming, and one carting
earth from its location to the building and assisting generally. The
plant required for this number of men is given below. If more are
engaged, additional plant of the same character will be found
advantageous.</p>

<p>“The necessary plant will consist of&mdash;2 wooden rammers,
1&nbsp;iron shod rammer, 2&nbsp;straight boxes, 2&nbsp;angle boxes,
3&nbsp;casings for blocking up the ends of boxes, bolts and keys for
same, 12 gauge rods, washers&mdash;a liberal supply of ¾-in. washers,
2&nbsp;shovels, 1&nbsp;spade, a&nbsp;horse and dray or other means for
transporting the material to the building (if&nbsp;required).”</p>

<h6>STUDDING, WIRE-NETTING, AND PISÉ</h6>

<p>“This is a modification of Pisé, which provides a settler in a
district where poles and saplings are available with a quick method of
providing himself with a comfortable temporary residence without the
expenditure of much cash. To construct buildings of this character,
a&nbsp;framework of saplings or poles, at intervals of 3&nbsp;ft.
6&nbsp;in. to 3&nbsp;ft. apart, is first erected; this framework is
covered on both sides with 1¼ in. mesh wire-netting. The two sections of
netting are held together, strengthened, and prevented from stretching
and bulging between the posts by means of wire hooks or loops, which are
as long as the posts are wide.
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<a name = "page88" id = "page88"> </a>
The spaces thus enclosed by the netting and the poles are then filled
with earth, which is well rammed, thus making a solid wall 4&nbsp;in. to
6&nbsp;in. thick. This wall can be plastered, the plaster forming a key
with the wire-netting, which holds securely. Buildings of this character
can be made to look rather attractive, and, if neatly constructed, are
very much superior, both in appearance and comfort, to slabs or wattle
and daub.”</p>

Pisé Shuttering</span></p>

<h6>PISÉ SHUTTERING<br>
<a name = "shutterI" id = "shutterI">I</a></h6>

<p>That the plant now commonly in use for pisé-building is but a slight
improvement on the anciently accepted model, may be seen by a comparison
of modern examples with old engravings and descriptions. Pisé-building
lay off the great main stream of constructional activity, and the
enterprise and ingenuity lavished on the perfecting of other building
materials and methods passed Pisé by, leaving it undisturbed in its
quiet backwater, a&nbsp;primitive system still with its primitive
tackle.</p>

<p>Yet there were a number of very obvious and unnecessary shortcomings
in the accepted shuttering that seemed to clamour for attention,
defects, too, that were in no way inherent, but merely traditional
infelicities reproduced in succeeding models that remained remarkably
true to their primitive ancestral architype&mdash;the Pisé plant
described by Pliny.</p>

<p>Here seemed to be a very promising field for an ingenious inventor,
a&nbsp;field that is still “To Let.”</p>

<p>In the absence of any such inventive genius, the author has had
certain ideas of his own embodied in the “Mark&nbsp;V” type of
shuttering&mdash;a type that further experience and experiment will
doubtless modify.</p>

<p>The principle of the building-process remains unaffected. The
improvements, such as they are, are merely improvements of mechanism<ins

<p>The chief desiderata in designing a satisfactory Pisé plant appear to
be these:</p>

<p>All constituent parts should be reasonably light and easy to handle.
The shutters should be rigid and not liable to warp, without being
expensively constructed. The shutters, when clamped in position, should
be firmly and positively supported, without deviation from the
vertical.</p>

<p>The fairway between the shutters must be as little obstructed by the
cross-braces as may be, leaving good room for the men on the wall to
tread and ram.</p>

<p>The through-pins by which the shuttering rests upon the base wall or
on a completed course of Pisé, must be easily withdrawn without injury
to the wall.</p>

<p>The shuttering must be easily disengaged and removed from the wall,
one side at a time.</p>

<p>The special corner-piece must have some means of rigid attachment to
the ordinary shutters on the two meeting walls.</p>

<p>There must be some means of blocking off the shuttering at any
desired point, for the forming of door or window openings at any
level.</p>

<p>The whole apparatus must be as simple and as fool-proof as possible,
and built to stand rough usage and exposure to the weather.</p>

good deal of attention from the Press, both at home and abroad. It has
been inspected by multitudes of people, including a great number of
Colonials and prospective Colonists, and by many distinguished persons
directly or indirectly concerned with the problems of housing.</p>

<p>That “Good wine needs no bush” may be a true saying, but a novel
system of building assuredly needs demonstration, however great its
merits. The success of the experiment at Newlands is admitted by all who
have made the pilgrimage thither. Often would critics come to scoff and
remain to pray. Specially prized amongst the converts is a
foreman-bricklayer once openly scornful in his unbelief. Of enthusiasm,
perhaps, there has been almost over much; and it has been difficult to
restrain the zeal of would-be pisé-builders until the coming of spring,
and the return of such weather conditions as the craft might reasonably
demand.</p>

<p>For pisé is a “dry-earth” method of building, and, as at present
practised, that means it is a summer job, so far, at any rate, as
England is concerned.</p>

<p>The author is the last person to claim that pisé-building may be
successfully and economically carried out in all places, and at all
seasons. He merely suggests that in a great many parts of the United
Kingdom, pisé offers possibilities of cheap yet permanent building that
are very well worth exploitation.</p>

<p>A wide and thorough trial of the method now seems assured under a
variety of conditions in a sufficient variety of places. Pisé is to be
given its chance in Housing Schemes, in Government building
demonstrations, on Ducal estates, and by ordinary private citizens in
need of houses&mdash;by the rich (old and new), and by the poor.</p>

<h6>THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION PISÉ DE TERRE HOUSE<br>
AT NEWLANDS CORNER, NEAR GUILDFORD</h6>

<p class = "center"><i>With acknowledgments to the “Spectator”</i></p>

<p><i>Description.</i>&mdash;The house has six rooms arranged on one
floor, of areas and cubical contents as laid down in their higher
“schedules of accommodation” by the Ministry of Health and the Board of
Agriculture.</p>

<p>The plan is an adaptation of the first type illustrated in the
Board’s new manual “designed for the guidance of
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92" id = "page92"> </a>
County Councils and their architects” in the matter of buildings for
small-holdings.</p>

<p>The walls are of 18-in. solid pisé-work, the roof of red Bridgewater
tiles, and the chimney breasts and stacks of brickwork.</p>

<p>The floors are boarded save for the back kitchen, which is tiled. The
inner partitions are of 2-in. breeze blocks, the ceilings are plastered,
and the casement windows are of steel.</p>

<p>There are two good lofts for storage, one entered from the barn,
which is an extension of the house proper.</p>

<p>The pillars of the barn and the partition wall between scullery and
veranda are of 18 in. by 9&nbsp;in. by 9&nbsp;in. rammed earth blocks;
the angle pillar to the veranda is of similar blocks made from soft
chalk.</p>

<p>The rest of the structure is of monolithic pisé, built up <i>in
situ</i> without joints of any kind, either horizontally or
vertically.</p>

<p><i>Cost.</i>&mdash;The total cost of the whole of the outer walling
of the house (in&nbsp;pisé) amounted to less than £20. Had the walls
been built in brickwork the cost would, according to estimate, have been
about £200.</p>

The Newlands Specification</span></p>

<p><i>Specification.</i>&mdash;The following is an abridged extract from
the specification so far as it affects the pisé-builder:</p>

<p>(1) Excavate to a depth of 9 in. over the site, dumping the turf and
surface humus where directed.</p>

<p>This soil is not to be used for building.</p>

<p>(2) Lay a 6-in. bed of cement and flint concrete 3 ft. wide under
outer walls. Centrally on this, lay two courses of brickwork in cement,
to a width of 18 in., or build up to the same extent in concrete.</p>

<p>Lay on this an approved damp-proof course; if of slates, having a
further course of brickwork or concrete above it to prevent fracture
when ramming.</p>

A Swedish Contribution</span></p>

<h6>THE THEORY OF PISÉ</h6>

<p>The Swedish scientist, Mr. Karl Ellington, of Nossebro, who is basing
a book on pisé (in&nbsp;his own tongue) upon the frail foundation of the
present volume, has, in the course of a letter to the author, made some
exceedingly suggestive “guesses at the truth.”</p>

<p>“I am very interested to hear that you are proposing to use an
hydraulic rammer for making blocks. I&nbsp;have thought a good deal
about this pressure business. I&nbsp;am trying to scrutinise the thing
from ‘the inside,’ so to speak. I&nbsp;am trying to trace out how Nature
makes rock. That helps us to understand pisé. Nature made all the
stratified rocks out of what was once fine loose earth and mud. Rivers
carried the mud out to sea. Waves pounded and gnawed the shores and got
down some more stuff. The tides went forth and back and shovelled and
levelled at the sea-bottom. Some more mud on top of that, and a few
hundred or thousand feet of the heavy water on top of that&mdash;and
Nature’s pisé was in its making. But why do these mud particles stick
together for ever even after that stratum is raised up high above the
sea and the pressure is discontinued? That is the counterpoint of the
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<a name = "page96" id = "page96"> </a>
whole problem. What is gravitation? Is it some form of magnetic or
electric energy? We don’t know. Do particles of mud grip and hold each
other if they are forced together close enough to be united by some sort
of magnetic or electric energy? Or do the particles only get a
‘mechanical’ grip on each other? However that may be, we seem to know
now that we can make them grip by bringing them closely together. It
would seem important, then, that we must bring as much of particle
surfaces together within any given cubic space as we possibly can; that
is, we must have as little of ‘holes,’ ‘empty spaces,’ pores and
channels as possible in the mass, in the pressed wall. This, then, would
in turn make it important that plenty of very fine (small) particles
must be present in the mass&mdash;and so well distributed among the
coarser particles as to be on hand close by wherever there can be one
more chance for a small particle to fill a little chamber that the
coarser particles would like to bridge over. We can think of how well
Nature was fitted for this work of shuffling over all the particles at
the sea-bottom and under great water pressure till she got every
particle into the niche where it would exactly fit. She used waves,
tides, and gulf streams as shovels and mixers and packers, and the water
above as ‘hydraulic rammer.’ Looking at the pisé matter in this way, it
would appear that both the <i>mixing</i> and the <i>shuffling</i> are of
vital importance. And by ‘shuffling’ I&nbsp;mean in this connection only
that the smaller and larger particles get a chance to shift over a
little during the process of pressing the earth together to hardness, so
that the pressure may not work only and exclusively in a straight
downward direction, but in a sort of wavy zigzag direction as
well&mdash;much as when a street-roller is working the macadam and
gravel a little forth and back at the same time as downward. I&nbsp;have
a great respect for old tools which are the outcome of long-time
experience and handed-down wisdom. I&nbsp;suspect the presence of some
of that sort of experience
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>
in the rammer described in your book, p. 59. That tool would do the
necessary shifting while attending to its <i>main</i> intention:
hammering the mass solidly together downwards. Now for your hydraulic
rammer&mdash;is it advisable to make it blow or press only in a straight
line downward? Maybe there ought to be two or three kinds of strokes
alternating&mdash;one stroke with a rifled or wavy surface under the
rammer&mdash;and the next stroke with a <i>plane</i>
surface.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What sort of witchcraft enters into the
effect of <i>high frequency blows</i> as compared with blows with a
little longer intervals between? Do the strokes create also some
‘magnetic’ effect in the pounded earth-mass which helps to fasten the
particles to each other? And does this magnetic charge or friction heat,
or whatever it is, act more promptly if one keeps on ‘striking the iron
while hot,’ instead of letting the charge ‘evaporate’ and sneak away
between strokes? Two or three of my hairs are turning grey over these
questions alone. You compliment me by insinuating that I might stumble
across some fruitful idea for the forms or boxes if I speculate a little
more on the key-problem. Well, the thing won’t leave me alone, so I have
thought out several foolish variations and rejected them too. But the
last one seems to have a little more vitality, so if it will live till I
write my next letter I will tell you about it. One is so apt to follow
the temptation of ‘perfecting’ an apparatus&mdash;at the cost of getting
away from keeping it cheap, simple&mdash;and ‘fool-proof.’ By this time
the idea has grown ripe in my mind, so that I ought to write out a
little book on the pisé problem in Swedish and have it printed before
springtime. Something ought to be done.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have to
ask you kindly to permit me to make use of the data contained in your
book. To this I will have to add what special precautions we must
observe as to foundations in a climate like ours. I&nbsp;intend to treat
only the pisé method. Cob and chalk methods are not applicable here, as
we have such materials only in a few unimportant spots.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ellington has long been an admirer and a firm friend of England,
and he is good enough to regard his country as indebted to ours for the
introduction of pisé-building:</p>

<p>“Let me tell you that the help you are giving me now&mdash;not me,
but my nation&mdash;will work as an additional bond that draws us more
closely towards each other.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some of our people here
have always looked too much towards the South and too little towards the

A Pisé-Builder’s School</span></p>

<h6>PISÉ, PRACTICE AND PLANT</h6>

<p>Now that so many able architects and enterprising bodies are
seriously taking up pisé-building, the improvement in plant and
technique should be both rapid and considerable. The School of Pisé
Building established at Hornchurch in Essex, by the Imperial Ex-service
Association, should alone provide us with much new and valuable
knowledge of a highly practical kind.</p>

<p>It is there, for instance, that various types of shuttering and
rammers are being experimentally tested side by side, and their relative
efficiency under varying conditions ascertained. Under some conditions
it is probable that the floor and roof timbers (destined for use in the
house under construction) will be found the most economical and
satisfactory form of temporary “shuttering” for the making of the earth
walls.</p>

<p>The pisé “Test-House,” built by Messrs. Alban Richards at their
Ashstead works, was built in this way, and proved highly
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Another effective and more generally applicable form of shuttering
(designed and manufactured by the same firm) is illustrated in the
diagram reproduced below. It should be observed that wedges intervene
between the movable shutters and the uprights.</p>

<p>The method of employment of the “Mark V” shuttering
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page99" id = "page99"> </a>
is well illustrated by the bird’s-eye view showing the Newlands cottage
under construction.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Alternative Shutterings</span></p>

<p>In this matter of shuttering there is still, however, great scope for
improvement, and it may be hoped that soon ingenuity and experience will
jointly produce a complete pisé plant perfectly fulfilling all the many
conditions enumerated earlier in the book.</p>

<p>Shuttering made by riveting plain galvanised sheet iron to one side
of a corrugated sheet has the qualities of lightness, smoothness,
cheapness, and rigidity, and the claims of the inventor and patentee are
now being put to the test in actual building.</p>

<p>There now seems little doubt but that pisé blocks will be largely
used for partitions and chimney stacks where the soil is good enough,
and experiments are being made with a view to discovering the best and
cheapest way of making earth slabs similar to those of coke-breeze and
concrete.</p>

<p>The size aimed at is 18 in. by 18 in. by 3 in., the edges to be
tongued and grooved.</p>

<p>Certain “concrete” machines seem to lend themselves to adaptation for
the making of earth blocks, but it is necessary to remember that sharp
blows are required rather than a steady pressure, and also that we are
working with a <i>dry</i> material. The ordinary primitive way of making
pisé blocks is indicated below.</p>

PISÉ HAND RAMMERS</p>
</div>

<p>The hand-rammers are undoubtedly worth study and careful design.
A&nbsp;set of three seems to meet all ordinary requirements, and those
shown on p. 101 may be taken as typical. They should be of hard-wood,
smoothly finished, and provided with long handles. They should be
9&nbsp;in. to 12 in. long, and about 5&nbsp;in. by 4&nbsp;in. at maximum
cross section.</p>

<p>In the sketch they are shown “narrow-ways-on.” No. 1&nbsp;is used for
preliminary pounding and final finishing, No. 2&nbsp;for general
consolidating, and No. 3&nbsp;for working along the edges, against
window stops, and under cross-ties.</p>

<p>A South African correspondent, Major Baylay, makes interesting
comment as regards rammers and local pisé practice:</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
South Africa</span></p>

<p>“My experience of all black labour is, that they won’t put any ‘guts’
into it. They therefore want fairly heavy rammers, which they can lift
and drop, say a foot, and which will do the rest for them. The heat of
the sun and extreme dryness of atmosphere out here make it advisable to
cover up completed courses at once with sacking, moist for choice,
otherwise it is liable to dry out too quickly and crack. It dries out
uncovered at night very well, when there is no rain.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<a name = "page101" id = "page101"> </a>
<p>“The red loams of South Africa, where not too sandy, make excellent
pisé. They or their equivalent are found almost everywhere. In the dry
state they set so hard that moisture added just before ramming is
useless. A&nbsp;large heap must be made, well damped and covered over
with moist sacking, and left until the moisture is distributed
throughout the mass. When about four or five days old, in ordinary
weather, the earth is ready to use&mdash;viz., just wet enough to bind
when gripped in the hand. It should be passed through a sieve.
I&nbsp;use a sort of ‘chicken run,’ 8&nbsp;ft. long, and throw the earth
on to it before using. Six feet of it is ½-in. mesh, and 2&nbsp;ft.
¼-in. mesh; the reason for this is that, if the earth is a little too
dry, it does not always bind well with the previous layer. Therefore,
put a few petrol tins of the fine earth into the shuttering first in
order to ensure good bond, and throw the coarser stuff in after.”</p>

mixture of 6 earth, 2&nbsp;sand, 1&nbsp;blue (Hyd.) lime, the earth
being the red, rather ‘fat’ earth found everywhere, and the same stuff
the house is built of. It is put on thin with a trowel, after damping
the wall. When it dries and cracks, rub all over with a sacking pad
covered with the plaster mixture, but wetted to a thin cream
consistency. It may sound an odd method, but the natives do this work
well, and the result is as good as one can wish for. You can put tar or
any wash (No.&nbsp;6) on this.”</p>

<h6>SOILS</h6>

<p>Were it not for the fact (often somewhat embarrassing) that soil
quite incapable of making good pisé will none the less produce
enthusiastic pisé-builders, a&nbsp;warning as to the vital importance of
the earth being really suitable might seem superfluous.</p>

<p>The author has found some of the staunchest champions of
pisé-building living on and valiantly struggling with stiff glutinous
clay and almost pure sand.</p>

<p>Even the most vigorous optimism can achieve little under such adverse
conditions unless soil-blending be resorted to, and even so,
pisé-building begins to lose points in the matter of economy directly
complications of this sort are introduced.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, England is well off in the matter of pisé
soils, the red marls being amongst the very best.</p>

<p>A study of the country, or, failing that, of the geological maps,
will reveal a great tract of this earth extending diagonally right
across England, from Yorkshire down into Devonshire, where it ends
conspicuously in the beautiful red cliffs about Torquay.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<a name = "page103" id = "page103"> </a>
<p>There is a large area of the stuff in the Midlands, notably in
Warwickshire, with lesser patches here and there about the country.</p>

<p>Second only to the red marls come the brick earths, which,
fortunately, are also widely distributed.</p>

<p>“Brick earth” is merely clay that has been well weathered and
disintegrated under the action of wind, rain, frost, and organic agents,
the sulphides having become oxides, and what was a cold intractable
slithery mass having become merely a “strong” and binding earth.</p>

<p>It is probable that even stiff clay, if dug in the summer or autumn,
and left exposed for a winter, would prove sufficiently reformed to be
quite amenable for pisé building in the spring.</p>

<p>After the marls and the brick earths there is an endless variety of
soils that will serve well for pisé-building&mdash;some, of course,
better than others, but all, save the extremes (the excessively light
and the excessively clayey), capable of giving good results under proper
treatment.</p>

<p>Before putting pisé construction actually in hand, however, the
intending builder will do well to submit samples of his earth to some
competent authority, that they may receive his blessing.</p>

<p>A fistful taken from a depth of 9 in., and another from say
2&nbsp;ft. below the surface, should give sufficient evidence as to the
soil’s suitability or the reverse.</p>

“The pisé does not admit any vegetable or animal substances. In mud
walls they put straw, chopped hay, hair, flocks, wool, etc., to make the
mud adhere to the wood, or laths; whereas the workmen who build in pisé
are careful to pick out the least straw or the smallest bit of root
which remains in the earth: in short, the pisé is a mineral substance
imitating stone, consequently anything that can slake or rot must be
excluded.”</p>

“A convenient arrangement might be: to make the lower and upper
connecting bars alike, to raise the side boarding a few inches above the
upper bars, which, when embedded, might be allowed to remain and become

General</h5>

<p><span class = "firstword">Chalk</span>, as a source of lime, has
always been of high importance to builders, and, until improved
transport brought alien materials into its old preserves, chalk was in
general use for walling in the form of roughly squared blocks.</p>

<p>Chalk again forms the basis of a compost that, used in the form of a
stiff paste, has been largely employed for building from the earliest
times down to the present.</p>

<p>“Pisé de Craie,” or chalk consolidated by ramming within a casing, is
a form of building that has been long held in high repute in France and
elsewhere, but which has only recently been given a serious trial in
England.</p>

<p>Chalk in all these forms, if fairly dealt with and reasonably
protected from the weather, is a most amenable and satisfactory material
to build with.</p>

<p>The last-named method particularly seems to promise results that
should satisfy the most exacting critics of the unconventional, as it
assuredly does those who inhabit the cottages so constructed.</p>

<p>The several systems of chalk construction are fully dealt with in the
pages that follow.</p>

<p><i>Chalk Compost: Historical.</i>&mdash;At the Ancient British
village on West Down, Chilbolton, some five miles south of Andover,
delving archæologists have brought to light undeniable fragments of
chalk “Daub,” with the wattle marks still clearly showing upon them.</p>

<p>This discovery is chiefly of academic interest, though
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
it is a pretty refutation to those who regard any building material save
brick and stone as “new-fangled,” and it should also serve to hearten
the doubters and the timid amongst us who seek historic sanction for any
departure from current building practice.</p>

<p><i>Composition and Uses.</i>&mdash;In the Andover district Chalk
Compost or “Chalk Mud,” as it is called locally, is prepared and used as
follows:</p>

<p>The chalk is dug out in the autumn, and the frost allowed to play on
it during the winter. In the spring building starts, and the weathered
chalk is spread all around the outside of the walls. Straw is sprinkled
on it and it is then well trodden, usually by the workers, but sometimes
by horses. Sometimes chopped straw is added, sometimes unchopped straw
is sprinkled on. The quality of the walls depends very largely on the
preparation&mdash;that is, in getting the mud to the right
consistency&mdash;and the old hands know by experience when it is
ready.</p>

<p>The compost is lifted on the wall by a fork and another man stands on
the wall and treads it in. It is then chopped down straight with a
spade. Some of the naked walls at Andover show traces of the courses,
which are usually something under 2&nbsp;ft. in height.</p>

<p>Where a course has to be left unfinished it should be ended with a
diagonal ramp so as to splice in with the work that follows.</p>

<p>Some of the old builders seem to have been somewhat catholic in their
conceptions as to what constituted “chalk,” and vague patches of earth,
loose flints and other stray substances not infrequently mar their work
and sometimes seriously reduce its strength.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the finer the chalk the stronger and more durable
is the walling.</p>

<p>What is aimed at is a conglomerate of small chalk knobs cemented
together by a matrix of plastic chalk and straw, the whole forming as
dense a mass as possible.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<a name = "page109" id = "page109"> </a>
<p>Grinding in a mortar-mill would probably reduce all the chalk to an
amorphous powder, which would not be desirable, and in any case such
mechanical mixing is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>Building by ramming the moist compost between timber shutterings does
not appear to have been practised in the past, though there is nothing
against the method except its tendency to delay the drying out.</p>

<p>The drying of each course takes several days, depending on the
weather. A&nbsp;course is usually laid right round the building. It must
be covered up at night in case of rain, and when it is hard another
course is laid on, and so on till completion. The aim is to build during
the summer and autumn, and when the moisture has dried out, to render
the exterior.</p>

<p>Where brickwork is used with chalk compost it is generally bonded
<ins class = "correction" title = "not an error">in in</ins> the
ordinary way, but block-bonding the depth of a chalk course is a better
way of doing&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The exterior corners of chalk buildings are the vulnerable points,
and these should therefore be well rounded off.</p>

<p><i>Timber.</i>&mdash;In the old work nothing seems to have been done
to prevent woodwork built in to the compost from decaying, though in
many cases it has survived surprisingly. In any new work, however,
proper ventilated air-spaces should be contrived or the timber ends
treated with some preservative.</p>

<p>The door and window frames are fixed to fairly large pieces of wood
built in across the thickness of wall, and other woodwork is fixed to
wood blocks built <ins class = "correction" title = "not an error">in
in</ins> a similar way.</p>

<p>Picture-rails should be provided in all rooms, as chalk walls are apt
to flake and chip if nails are driven into them.</p>

<p>Lintels are usually of wood, and when plastering is carried down over
these some form of key must of course be provided to hold&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Winter Work Barred</span></p>

<p><i>Frost.</i>&mdash;New work must not be exposed to frost or there
will be danger of collapse, and winter work is barred out for this
reason.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<a name = "page110" id = "page110"> </a>
<p><i>Repairs.</i>&mdash;Chalk compost walls are not easily repaired in
that material, and bricks are generally used, well bonded&nbsp;in.</p>

<p><i>Chimneys.</i>&mdash;Chimneys, too, are usually of brick, though
there would seem no reason against the flues being carried up in chalk,
especially if clay pipe linings were used.</p>

<p>The chimney-stacks above the roof might well be built in flint, the
corners being rounded off in deference to the peculiarities of the
material.</p>

<p><i>External Rendering.</i>&mdash;It is of the first importance that a
good weather-tight skin be maintained, and many old buildings have
suffered through neglect of this precaution.</p>

<p>The rendering was often of the poorest quality, more mud than lime,
and the constant repairs that the indifferent materials necessitated has
resulted in many of the old cottages becoming patchworks of variegated
plaster blotches, when not whitewashed over, which give an impression of
dilapidation by no means warranted by the facts.</p>

<p><i>Rendering.</i>&mdash;Given a good skin, however, of cement or
cement and lime, a&nbsp;chalk conglomerate wall will last indefinitely.
So vital is the skin that it is as well to put it on in two good
coats&mdash;rounding off all the corners and finishing it either with
slap-dash or rough from the wooden float.</p>

<p>Also, to ensure its proper adhesion throughout, wire-netting may be
used as reinforcement&mdash;being secured to the face of the chalk wall
by means of cross netting or wires laid on the wall as the building
rises.</p>

<p>If the netting be of a fine mesh it also serves as an absolute
barrier to vermin, though pounded glass incorporated in the base of the
wall is equally effective.</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i>&mdash;Provided the wall has dried out thoroughly,
any of the ordinary loads occurring in a two-storied house can be borne
with ease.</p>

<p>Chalk conglomerate walling, however, has no great lateral strength,
and it should not be asked to stand up to thrusts.</p>

<p>The roof, therefore, must be well tied, and should sit on the
building merely as a lid.</p>

<p><i>Roof.</i>&mdash;Though thatch is the traditional roofing material
of chalk cottages, any other will serve that is permanent and good of
its kind.</p>

<p>The only special demand that chalk walls make is that the eaves shall
be generously overhung for their better protection from the weather.</p>

<p>Where, in later years, the boldly projecting thatch has been
thoughtlessly replaced by a slate roof with meagre eaves, or with none
at all, the walls have suffered accordingly.</p>

Garden Walls</span></p>

<p><i>Garden Walls.</i>&mdash;A chalk garden wall must be afforded just
as much protection as the wall of a house and on both sides.</p>

<p>The hat with which it is provided is of the highest importance to the
health and longevity of the walling.</p>

<p>Examples of garden wall copings are given in the sketches shown
below.</p>

WALL COPINGS.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<a name = "page112" id = "page112"> </a>
<p><i>House Walls.</i>&mdash;Chalk conglomerate walls rarely exceed 18
in. in thickness, and are usually the same upstairs as down.</p>

<p>A plinth of the same thickness as the chalk wall it supports is
usually carried up 6&nbsp;in. to 18 in. above the ground level in
rubble-work, flint, or brick, being known as the “Underpin Course.” Any
of the stock damp-courses are suitable, but they must be well and truly
laid, as damp feet are nearly as deleterious to a chalk wall as a leaky
or inadequate hat.</p>

<p>No special tools are required for this method of building, an
ordinary farm fork for lifting and a spade for the final chopping down
of the wall faces being all that are necessary.</p>

<p>A house built during the summer is usually fit for occupation the
same autumn.</p>

<p><i>Old Examples.</i>&mdash;Those who may wish to see buildings in
chalk conglomerate, both old and new, would do well to visit some such
typical chalk district as that lying about Andover in Wiltshire.</p>

<p>It should, however, be constantly borne in mind that most of the old
cottages were somewhat unscientifically erected by their original
jack-of-all-trades occupiers, that damp-courses and Portland cement were
unknown, and that the advantages of proper ventilation and the causes of
dry-rot were discoveries yet to be made.</p>

<p>Secondly, a large number of these cottages have been sadly neglected
either recently or in the past, and they bear the disfiguring marks of
their ill-treatment upon them now.</p>

<p>But a chalk cottage that is well found in the beginning, and that is
reasonably well cared for subsequently, has nothing to fear from
comparison with cottages built in the most approved manner of the more
fashionable materials.</p>

<p>Mr. James Thorold gives the following particulars of a block of three
chalk cottages recently built for Sir George Cooper on his estate at
Hursley, near Winchester:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
<p>“The chalk walling was done by Messrs. A. Annett and Son, of
Winterslow, near Salisbury, where this method of building has been kept
alive from olden days. It consists of working up the soft upper strata
of the chalk by putting a bed of it 4&nbsp;ft. 6&nbsp;in. thick on the
ground, watering and treading it to a sticky consistency with the feet,
working in shortish straw at the same time. When thoroughly mixed by the
builder’s mate, he lifts up a forkful to the builder working on the wall
immediately above him, the latter catches the chalk, dumps it down on
the top of the wall, building an 18 in. course all round. As soon as the
weather has dried this sufficiently he goes round with a sharp spade
squaring up both sides of the wall. As this work is greatly dependent on
the weather it is well if the men have other work to fall back on, and
that building operations should be commenced in the spring or early
summer. The wall is built 18 in. thick to the first floor joists and 14
in. above. Chalk in itself being very absorbent of moisture, the usual
plan is to render the outside of the wall with a lime mortar, which,
however, requires renewal every few years. To obviate this we fixed with
long staples 1¼ in. mesh wire-netting over the outside surface of the
wall to give a reinforcement for a rendering of hair mortar and cement
gauged in proportion of 1 to 2 respectively, and left rough from the
trowel. This rendering was done at a cost of 3<i>s.</i> 3½<i>d.</i> per
square yard, which is a substantial addition to the cost of the walling,
but so far there is no sign of a crack or hollow place behind it, and
the cottages have kept very dry. The walls were finished off with a
limewash containing Russian tallow and copperas.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a></p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Cost of Three Cottages</span></p>

<p>“As regards the cost of this block of three cottages, the result is
obscured by the fact that tall chimney-stacks with ornamental bricks and
appropriate foundations were built and reinforced leaded lights were
used in the windows
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
to keep the building in character with the other cottages on the estate,
but at the time we estimated that the chalk walling saved a sum of £54
as against the amount we should have had to have spent in carrying out
the building with bricks made on the estate, and this had to include
lodging money and profit, the builders being independent men. The
ornamental chimney-stacks were put in for the sake of appearance, flues
built up in the chalk being entirely satisfactory and fireproof. The
foundations are either flint or brick with a slate damp-course.</p>

<p>“I consider that for a chalk country this method of building has many
advantages.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
“(1) It saves cartage.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
“(2) It can be carried out by a skilled labourer who can be otherwise
employed during unsuitable weather.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
“(3) No fuel is required as in burning bricks.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
“(4) If a suitable rendering is employed to keep it weatherproof, and a
good damp-course on the foundations, the cottages are nice and dry and
keep an equable temperature, chalk being a good non-conductor.</p>

<p>“Sir George wonders if any method could be devised by chemical means
to harden the chalk and make it weatherproof; if this could be done it
might save the expense of the cement rendering.”</p>

<p>From <i>Country Life</i>, February 23rd, 1901:</p>

<p>“Soft chalk is practically mud, yet Dr. Poore, one leading authority
on rural hygiene, had his model hygienic cottage built with it at
Andover, just outside the boundaries, in order to escape the tyranny of
the bye-laws. In several other places this material has been used time

<h6>THE WINTERSLOW COTTAGES</h6>

<p>From <i>Country Life</i>, April 6th, 1901:</p>

<p>“The white chalk cottages of the scattered straggling village are
found in every sort of position. They must not be confounded with the
cottages of rock chalk at Medmenham. You might almost call them mud
cottages.</p>

<p>“The house is generally both planned and constructed by the
owner.</p>

<p>“. . . The soil is only a few inches deep, soft chalk lies close to
the surface and can be dug out with a spade. This is a very suitable
material in the district and costs nothing but the labour of
digging.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“On the downs there is a constant lack of water; that which falls in
the shape of rain is therefore very precious, and in some cases is
indeed the only kind available. But a large tank or artificial well is
needed to contain it, and the pit from which the chalk is dug out can be
made to serve the purpose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One was made watertight
by means of a lining of concrete, and held enough water to keep the
family going through all the dry season.</p>

<p>“In another house . . . the chalk-pit had been utilised to form a
large and convenient cellar.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“Most of them (the cottages) . . . are on two floors, with parlour,
kitchen, back kitchen and so forth on one, and the bedrooms on the
other. In the preparation of the chalk, the method followed is that of
treading it into a kind of rubble, and adding a proportion of straw and
a small quantity of lime.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Expensive Scaffolding Avoided</span></p>

<p>“There is a local builder who will run up the shell of a house for a
matter of £100, more or less, according to its
size.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Most of the cottages are literally hand-made.
A&nbsp;skilful architect who visited the Winterslow cottages
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
felt sure that boards must be used to keep the walls straight, but he
was wrong. The chalk is shovelled up and the walls are kept straight
without line or plummet. No expensive scaffolding or machinery is
employed. Yet the walls come out beautifully in the end, the colour
being an exquisite soft white. They are about 18 in. thick, and the
slowness of their construction has one good effect, it gives them time
to dry. No point is of more importance than this. It is advisable not to
put on any rough-cast, plaster, or paper for at least twelve months, as
doing so will prevent the moisture from exuding. One or two of the
little cottages were slightly damp, but the majority were as dry as
tinder. The thickness of the walls helps to render the cottage more
comfortable, to make it cool in summer and dry in winter.</p>

<p>“One word should be added in regard to soft chalk as a building
material. Where it can be obtained in the garden at a few inches depth,
and especially where the cottager is his own architect and builder, it
can be most heartily recommended, but there are obvious objections to
its transportation to districts where it is foreign.</p>

<p>“The village itself is a very homely and irregular one without a
single dwelling of any pretence. The country lying adjacent to Salisbury
Plain consists of broken, sparsely peopled downland, and very ornate or
finished cottages would be out of keeping, but they would not look so
well copied in a very rich, heavily timbered country.”</p>


<h6>RATS AND CHALK</h6>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Conglomerate chalk is, like cob, vulnerable to the
attacks of a really determined rat.</p>

<p>The outer defences provided by the exterior rendering can be backed
up by the mixing in of broken glass or sharp flints with the substance
of the wall, where such attacks are likely.</p>

<h6>BLOCK CHALK</h6>

<p>“Chalk” is a term somewhat loosely used to denote the soft white
limestone&mdash;the “<i>Creta Scriptoria</i>”&mdash;that is cousin to
Marl on one side and to Ragstone on the other.</p>

<p>In its purest form chalk consists of over 95 per cent. of carbonate
of lime in the form of fine granular particles held together by a
calcareous cement, its organic origin being clearly traced in the
remains of the minute sea creatures with which it abounds.</p>

<p>Hewn blocks of chalk have been used for walling and vaulting from
immemorial times, and, where not exposed to direct erosion by the
weather, remain to this day as clean-cut as when they were first
quarried and a very great deal harder.</p>

<p>The filling in of the great vaults at Salisbury Cathedral and in the
Bishop’s Palace are of chalk, whilst innumerable lesser buildings of
more or less antiquity still remain to us as monuments to the excellence
and durability of this stone.</p>

<p>Chalk, too, was often used in combination with flint or brick to
build the engaging chequer-work walls that embellish so many downland
villages.</p>

<p>At Medmenham there are cottages both old and new of hewn rock chalk,
and both the Berks and Bucks banks of the Thames have many buildings to
show of this beautiful material.</p>

<p>Amongst present-day architects Sir Edwin Lutyens was the first to
give hewn chalk an opportunity of showing its quality in serious
architecture, Marsh Court in Hampshire being an instance of more than
local celebrity.</p>

<p>In the great walls at the Bishop of Winchester’s palace, Farnham
Castle in Surrey, the old builders appear to have used bricks, limestone
and chalk proper, according as the several materials were delivered,
quite indifferently, and with results altogether delightful.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
<p>Not all chalk is suitable for building, that near the surface being
often far gone in decay and much too friable for such a purpose.</p>

<p>Even when apparently sound blocks have been gotten they are not
infrequently found to be crossed in all directions by planes of weakness
along which they are apt to fall to pieces in the handling.</p>

<p>From this cause the “waste” is sometimes considerable.</p>

<p>The well-known building “stones” from the quarries of Beer, Sutton,
and Tottenhoe in Devonshire are really chalk, but in a form not readily
distinguishable from ordinary free-stone.</p>

<p>The longer that chalk blocks are kept to dry before building-in the
better, and the sun and wind of at least a year should be allowed free
play upon them to dry out their natural sap and render them
“frost-proof.”</p>

<p>During the drying-out process the chalk should, if possible, be
protected from the rain.</p>

<p>For years after being built into the walls of a house, chalk will
continue to dry and harden.</p>

<p>But it is essentially a somewhat porous material, and will quickly
revenge itself on those neglecting its just demands for a sound roof and
a proper damp-course.</p>

<p>In exposed situations new chalk walling is liable to allow the
penetration of moisture under the pressure of the wind unless a cavity
is provided or unless the surface is treated with a silicate or other
“vitrifying” fluid.</p>

<p>Chalk, however, has one shining virtue in common with its great
antithesis&mdash;it improves mightily with keeping.</p>

<p>Chalk walls sometimes have youthful vices in the way of porosity that
entirely disappear with advancing years through the closing up of the
surface pores, which eventually makes a cavity and inner lining
superfluous.</p>

<i>UNBURNED CLAY AND EARTH BRICKS</i></h4>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Sun-dried Bricks</h5>

<p>The use of sun-dried bricks in this country, is, for no very apparent
reason, almost entirely restricted to East Anglia. There it has been
used for generations with entirely satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Mr. Skipper of Norwich writes of the material as follows:</p>

<p class = "space">
“Who, travelling from Norfolk to London, whether by the Ipswich or
Cambridge line, has not noticed the numerous colour-washed or black
(tarred) cottage, farmhouse and agricultural buildings scattered
practically all along the countryside? Some of these are of studwork and
plaster, some of wattle and daub, but many are built of clay made up
into lumps, sun-dried, and built into the walls with a soft clay-mixture
as mortar. No lime <i>need</i> be used, though sometimes it is mixed
with the clay mortar. The preparation, digging, exposure and mixing with
short straw are similar to the Devonshire ‘cob’ work, but in these parts
the worked clay is thrown into moulds, and lumps are formed of, say, 18
in. by 12 in. by 6&nbsp;in., or 18 in. by 9&nbsp;in. by 6&nbsp;in. for
large sizes, and for inside walling or backing to brick-faced walls, 18
in. by 6&nbsp;in. by 6&nbsp;in. The walls, naturally, are rough in
texture and the joints are generally stopped up and besmeared with a
thin coating or almost a wash of clay. This coating sometimes has lime
mixed with it, but it is not necessary. This is all that is needed to
complete the walling, and there is a building&mdash;a malting,
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
that any one can see at Tivetshall Station on the Ipswich line, about
200 ft. long, 45 ft. or 50 ft. wide and three floors high, built of
lumps 18 in. by 12 in. by 6&nbsp;in.&mdash;that has stood the weather
and weight of its roof for forty years built in this way; 12 in. is the
thickness of its walls. A&nbsp;further stage in finish is to give the
walls two or three coats of coal tar, but it is not essential, though
desirable where stock are kept, as cattle are rather fond of licking the
clay, and they do not use their horns much when walls are tarred. The
highest finish in this work is to cast sand on the last coating of tar
before it is quite dry, and then to colour or whitewash on this. This
accounts for the variety of colourings seen in these buildings, some
even of a kind of pink or red; while some yellow or buff, beside the
white and the black or tarred buildings, and all huddled together or
standing apart, whether covered with thatch or red pan or flat tiles,
look remarkably in harmony with their surroundings. These lump walls
are, of course, built on a base of brickwork, about 18 in. or 2&nbsp;ft.
high, to keep them free from damp. This kind of walling can be built for
<i>at least</i> 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. cheaper than ordinary
9&nbsp;in. brickwork. Thin as these walls are compared with those of
‘cob’ houses, they are noted for being warm in winter and cool in
summer. When suitable clay is procurable a local builder almost
invariably uses clay lumps when building a house for himself, though to
gratify a whim perhaps, he will case the outside walls&mdash;especially
the front next the street or road&mdash;with brickwork. But clay lumps
he carefully reserves for inside walls and weight-carrying linings to
the outside walls, bonding the two together very much in the same way as
two 4½ in. ‘cavity walls’ are bonded. I&nbsp;am not suggesting that this
walling is as interesting artistically as ‘cob,’ but I do suggest it is
a practical, sensible and <i>dry</i> walling, and if properly done it
will ‘last for ever,’ as a local builder repeatedly said to me when
speaking of it. One can easily see why
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
the cost is light&mdash;the sun and the winds do the drying in the
spring months, and no coals are required, and also the clay is often
found on the building site, hence no cartage. Actual building work
naturally goes quickly, as the lumps are large. There is another
important point to notice. One may see a building complete with its roof
on and occupied by its tenant while still awaiting an outside casing of
brickwork to be built round it, either with a view to greater protection
or for the mere vanity of the owner, for while thus left unprotected the
lump walls take no harm from even winter exposure. Now to be quite
practical in these extremely practical days, I&nbsp;venture to suggest
that the use of clay lumps at least for inside walls and linings of
outside walls would be an immense boon to the numerous cottage-building
schemes now being projected. We must not forget that comparatively few
bricks will be available this year, while the cottages are wanted at
once. Can these few bricks be better used than by forming foundations
and chimneys for the clay-lump walls of these cottages? I&nbsp;think
not. The cottages could, of course, be occupied in the late summer or
autumn of this year, and next year when bricks will be more plentiful
perhaps the brick casings could be added, if brickwork <i>must</i>
complete them. I&nbsp;make this strictly utilitarian suggestion solely
to meet a very urgent and deep national need. Personally, I&nbsp;prefer
the sight of a cottage built and finished in the old-established method
of the locality. Unskilled labour only is required, working under
intelligent supervision, hence immediate employment for a great number
of men would be provided.”</p>

<p>Of the strength of clay-lump walls, there is no question. It was
recently necessary to cut a new doorway in the old clay-lump wall of a
large traction-engine garage, and the blocks removed were thrown into a
heap upon the ground.</p>

<p>The clay happened to be needed for other purposes, for which it had
first to be broken&nbsp;up.</p>

heavy sledges were used that the lumps could be smashed.</p>

<p>“As their name implies, these buildings are constructed of sun-dried,
but unburnt bricks. For buildings of this character, material like clay,
which is unsuitable for pisé-work, can be used. The bricks are made in a
wooden mould, and are 16 in. long, 8&nbsp;in. wide, and 6&nbsp;in.
thick. A&nbsp;man can mould about 100 per day. They are laid in a
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
similar manner to other bricks, the mortar used being wet loam, or even
the material of which the bricks are made. The cost of making and laying
is estimated at about 15<i>s.</i> per 100. Buildings constructed of
these bricks are substantial and cool, and very similar in character to
pisé buildings.</p>

<p>“A school-house built of these bricks eighteen years ago by Mr.
Nixon, of Reefton, is still in an excellent state of preservation; in
fact, little, if any, the worse for wear, despite the fact that walls
are unprotected by verandahs or overhanging eaves. During its existence
it has had, first one coat of oil-paint, and later a coat of coloured
limewash.”</p>

<p>“Clay lump,” then, is one of the many good old building methods that
needs no proving, but only revival and perhaps improvement.</p>

WHITEWASH</h5>

<p>Whitewashing has been frequently referred to in the foregoing pages
as the most suitable treatment for the exterior of chalk and earth
buildings.</p>

<p>There is, however, a certain prejudice against lime-whiting amongst
both owners and occupiers, owing to the frequent renewal that its
adoption usually implies.</p>

<p>With a view to removing this drawback from a treatment otherwise so
effective, the following recipes are suggested as improvements on the
usual practice.</p>

<p>Ordinary whitewash is made by slaking about 10 lbs. of quicklime with
two gallons of water.</p>

<p>The following recipes are taken from “<i>White Paints and
Painting</i>” (Scott), and are reliable:</p>

<p>(1) “<i>Factory” Whitewash (interiors), for Walls, Ceilings, Posts,
etc.</i>:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p class = "hanging">
(<i>a</i>) 62 lbs. (1&nbsp;bushel) quicklime, slake with 15 gallons
water. Keep barrel covered till steam ceases to arise. Stir occasionally
to prevent scorching.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(<i>b</i>) 2½ lbs. rye-flour, beat up in ½ gallon of cold water, then
add 2 gallons boiling water.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(<i>c</i>) 2½ lbs. of common rock-salt, dissolve in 2½ gallons of hot
water.</p>
</div>

<p>Mix (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), then pour into (<i>a</i>), and stir
until all is well mixed. This is the whitewash used in the large
implement factories, and recommended by the insurance companies. The
above formula gives a product of perfect brush consistency.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128" id = "page128"> </a>
<p>(2) <i>“Weatherproof” Whitewash (exteriors), for Buildings, Fences,
etc.</i>:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p class = "hanging">
(<i>a</i>) 62 lbs. (1&nbsp;bushel) quicklime, slake with 12 gallons of
hot water.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(<i>b</i>) 2 lbs. common table salt, 1 lb. sulphate of zinc, dissolved
in a gallon of boiling water.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(<i>c</i>) 2 gallons skimmed milk.</p>
</div>

<p>Pour (<i>b</i>) into (<i>a</i>), then add the milk (<i>c</i>), and
mix thoroughly.</p>

<p>(3) <i>“Light House” Whitewash</i>:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p class = "hanging">
(<i>a</i>) 62 lbs. (1&nbsp;bushel) quicklime, slake with 12 gallons of
hot water.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(<i>b</i>) 12 gallons rock-salt, dissolve in 6 gallons of boiling
water.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
(<i>c</i>) 6 lbs. of Portland cement.</p>
</div>

<p>Pour (<i>b</i>) into (<i>a</i>), and then add (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p class = "space">
<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Alum added to a lime whitewash prevents it rubbing
off. An ounce to the gallon is sufficient.</p>

<p>Flour paste answers the same purpose, but needs zinc sulphate as a
preservative.</p>

<p>The following are from “<i>1,000 More Paint Questions
Answered</i>”:</p>

<p>(4) <i>Durable Whitewash for Outside Use.</i>&mdash;A whitewash that
will not rub off or wash off in rainy weather can be made by mixing one
half-pint of flour to a batter with cold water, then stirring into this
boiling water until it becomes a thick paste.</p>

<p>While still hot it is poured into a pailful of ready-made lime
whitewash and well stirred&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>(5) Another simple method is to add to 2 gallons of ready-made lime
whitewash one half-pint each of molasses and table salt. Must be stirred
frequently while being used.</p>

<p><i>Whitewash for Exterior Surfaces.</i>&mdash;A formula for a durable
whitewash for out-buildings of rough lumber. The following is reprinted
from “<i>Popular Mechanics</i>”:</p>

<p>(6) Place 1 bushel good fresh lime in a barrel with 20 lbs. beef
tallow; slake with hot water and cover with sackcloth to keep in steam.
When the lime is slaked, the tallow will have disappeared, having formed
a chemical compound with the lime. Dry colours may be added to produce
any tint desired.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href =
"#note10">10</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129" id = "page129"> </a>
<p>It is better to add colour before slaking the lime, but if this is
not feasible mix the colour with alcohol and add it to the strained
whitewash. Thin to easy flowing consistency with clear water.</p>

<p class = "headnote"><span class = "headnote">
Distempers and Limewashes</span></p>

<p><i>Cold Water Paint that will stand the Weather.</i>&mdash;A formula
for making a white outside coating that will resist the action of the
weather and remain hard even under the influence of moisture and rain.
Experiments with different brands of cold water paints have proved
failures.</p>

<p>A really effective cold water paint, in order to resist the elements
and remain white, should contain a white pigment of good body and some
oil in addition to the water, and with this purpose in view the
following is suggested:</p>

<p>(7) To make 100 lbs. of such paint, mix 10 lbs. white, pure in oil,
with 10 lbs. bolted whiting, 8&nbsp;lbs. raw linseed oil, 6&nbsp;lbs.
soft soap (made with potash), and 26 lbs. soft water.</p>

<p>One quart of pale copal varnish will improve the preparation. The
formula given is of the right consistency to apply on dressed lumber
with the brush. For application on rough lumber or with the spraying
machine it requires more thinning with water and varnish.</p>

<p>The following is taken from Pearce’s “<i>Painting and
Decorating</i>”:</p>

<p>(8) A London recipe for distemper has the following proportions:
4&nbsp;“balls” whiting, 2&nbsp;lbs. Young’s patent size, and sufficient
water to cover the whiting.</p>

<p>(9) A Scotch distemper is described as: 12 lbs. whiting, size as
given previously, 2&nbsp;ozs. alum, 2&nbsp;ozs. soft soap. It is very
fast, for passages, schools, etc. Tinting colours for limewash should be
restricted to ochres, umbers, lime blue, lime greens, charcoal or lamp
black, and earthy reds (as&nbsp;Venetian).</p>

<p>(10) External limewash for farm buildings, etc., may be made as
follows: Lime, ½&nbsp;bushel, slaked with 1 gallon of milk and remainder
of water, 1&nbsp;lb. salt and ½ lb. sulphate of zinc to make it
withstand the weather.</p>

<p>Experiments with and practical tests of these and other kinds of
whitewash are being carried out, and the author hopes that he may find
opportunity at some later date of announcing the results obtained.</p>

difficulties will have to be met. The first arises from the scarcity of
building material; the other from the cost and difficulty of transport.
These, to some extent, can be obviated by the use of local material,
which is to be commended on other grounds as well. Local material fits
into the character of the neighbourhood in which it is found and

<p>It will be seen that to carry out the scheme for 300,000 cottages a
total of close on 60,000,000 tons of material will have to be shifted.
In addition to that, it must be remembered that the
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>

cost of material is very small in comparison with that of building. This
will be apparent from an analysis of the items employed for actual cost
and the percentage which that cost bears to the total cost.</p>

<p>These facts help to clarify the problem. The weight of the building
materials required for an ordinary cottage with living-room, parlour,
scullery, three bedrooms, etc., the house containing cubic contents of
about 11,500 ft., would come approximately to 200 tons per cottage; and
even assuming that there is only an average transport of fifty miles,
this would give 10,000 ton-miles per rural cottage, which is taking it
at a very low average. In each cottage the weight of the brickwork
represents about 42 per cent. of the total weight. It is, therefore,
apparent that every effort should be made to lessen the transit of
materials required for the external walling. If, on the other hand,
local materials are employed, this carriage would be saved and a great
economy effected. Even if this utilitarian consideration were not so
important as it is, the desirability of making all possible use of local
materials is very great from other points of view. It would stimulate
local interest in building and, in addition to retaining the traditions
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132" id = "page132"> </a>
of the district, give greater hope of retaining and maintaining the
proper architectural aspect of our villages.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to summarise the advantages that may fairly
be expected to flow from this endeavour to make a real start at finding
a solution for the housing difficulty. First and foremost must be placed
the saving in transport. A&nbsp;casual reader may easily imagine that
the difficulties of carriage will vanish with the end of the war, but
that is not so in reality. Any one who has travelled in France must have
noticed engines bearing such names as Liverpool Street, King’s Cross,
Euston, Birmingham, and so on. The meaning of that is that a great deal
of our rolling stock was sent over to France, and at the best will not
be available here for a long time to come. Even the ordinary work of
upkeep and repair has necessarily been neglected owing to the scarcity
of men and other causes incidental to war-time. Transport difficulties
are bound to last for a very considerable period after the peace
settlement, and it would not be at all advisable to delay the
construction of houses so long. The returned soldiers will make us
vividly conscious of the shortage. Nothing could be imagined more likely
to make them look for chances of going abroad than to learn that there
is not sufficient housing accommodation for them in the village in which
they lived before the war, and to which they hoped to return on its
conclusion.</p>

EXTRACT FROM A LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF <i>COUNTRY LIFE</i>,
JULY&nbsp;27th,&nbsp;1918</h5>

<p>“Shortly before the war I had occasion to demolish some very old
cottages at Clovelly for the reconstruction of the New Inn. I&nbsp;was
so much struck with the stability of these (although by no means
first-class samples of cob work) that I collected some facts and notes
on the subject from different parts of the county of Devon. Where
bye-laws have been adopted, cob is no longer being used. It is
difficult, therefore, to give an accurate comparison of costs, but after
careful investigation I did arrive at the following results for North
Devon and Scotland. The prices were in 1913, and in both cases for a
five-roomed cottage
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
(assuming four to be built at the same time, including internal water
supply, but omitting any special work necessary to procure supply, and
omitting fencing).</p>

<p>These prices assumed suitable material on or near site, and allowed
something for the difficulty of getting at least one experienced
cob-worker to instruct the unskilled men. Since 1913 the cost of brick
has risen so much that cob would now be much cheaper, probably as much
as 1<i>d.</i> or 1¼<i>d.</i> foot cube in both cases, and this is likely
to be the case for many years. Suitable material exists in many parts of
the country. If reed straw cannot be had, other reinforcements can be
used. I&nbsp;have seen various materials in use, of which heather was
perhaps the best and most easily procured. I&nbsp;can endorse from
experience the comfort of these old buildings, and the affection of
Devon people for them. The thick walls give all that a house
should&mdash;protection from heat in summer and cold in winter. For the
contrast, visit the new Garden City at Rosyth. Many of the houses are
attractive, but their thin brick walls, tile and slate hanging are not
suitable to the north and east coasts. Ask the opinion of the occupants
of these new houses. Many of them are Devon born and bred, and imported
from the dockyards of the three towns. They nearly all complain of the
cold, and their views form an interesting comment on modern
construction.”</p>

PISÉ TESTS</h5>

<p class = "center">(<i>With acknowledgements to “The
Spectator”</i>)</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of Messrs. Alban Richards &amp; Co. we are able
to publish the results of certain very instructive tests that have been
carried out on Pisé during the past winter. Messrs. Richard’s experience
and Report bring out two points with especial clearness, (1)&nbsp;That
Pisé work, though not impossible under winter conditions, is not
ordinarily desirable unless some means of artificially drying the earth
be resorted to. (2)&nbsp;That the strength of Pisé increases with
surprising rapidity as
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134" id = "page134"> </a>
the work dries out. It should be remarked that none of the samples
tested were made from really good Pisé soil, such for instance as the
red marls or brick earths. With such materials or anything approaching
them, the results would have been even better, as the Report points
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In conjunction with Mr. Williams-Ellis, we have made certain tests
with a view to satisfying ourselves as to the practicability of <i>pisé
de terre</i> for house construction. In order to obtain what we might
term the minimum or ‘worst’ tests, we decided to erect walls for this
purpose in the winter. This we have done for the last three months,
which has been a very wet period, and the following is a short
description of the tests we have made:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "inset">
“1. Two walls were erected measuring 14 ft. long, 9&nbsp;ft. high and 18
in. thick, spaced 20 ft. apart, with short return ends to each wall.
Wall plates were placed centrally along the top of each wall, on which
were placed 9&nbsp;in. by 3&nbsp;in. wood joists, at 16 in. centres,
across the 20 ft span. In order to obtain the minimum results we allowed
the shutters to remain until the test was ready to be applied, so that
walls did not have an opportunity of drying or hardening. This condition
was thought necessary, as it is quite reasonable to expect that if
<i>pisé de terre</i> cottages are erected, considerable weight might be
placed on the walls immediately the shuttering is struck. We then
proceeded to test the walls to destruction. The floor space provided for
by the joists referred to above measure 220 super. feet, the load was
then applied gradually. The load applied totalled 16½ tons, which is
equivalent of 168 lbs. per super. foot of floor space, under which the
wall collapsed, which, in our opinion, provides a factor of safety of
three to the normal load which a cottage floor would have to bear.</p>

<p>“We are convinced that very much better results can be obtained in
this method of construction with walls which were first dried before the
load was applied. Further experiments are to be made to procure further
data on this subject. In addition to the above tests, we have submitted
to the National Physical Laboratory, blocks made of <i>pisé de
terre</i>, from poor to medium soil, for testing purposes, and the
following are the results which have been obtained:&mdash;</p>

wet one would upon drying.</p>

<p>“We are of opinion, having regard to the fact that the house at
Newlands Corner (Guildford four miles) has weathered the winter, without
showing any signs of dampness, that <i>pisé de terre</i> will make a
thoroughly dry house.</p>

<p>“We consider that the tests made are satisfactory, and prove that
this form of construction is of a sufficiently sound nature to be
employed in the building of houses. With really suitable material, such
as a light brick-earth or marl, it is considered that the results
already obtained might well be 100 per cent. better.”</p>

<p>We are informed that additional tests are now proceeding with regard
to the water-proof and weather-resisting qualities of Pisé, the results
of which will be duly published.</p>

<p>Pliny, <i>Natural History</i>, Bk. XXXV, chapter xlviii, quoted at
end of Introduction:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“<i>Have we not in Africa and in Spain walls of earth, known as
‘formocean’ walls? From the fact that they are moulded, rather than
built, by enclosing earth within a frame of boards, constructed on
either side. These walls will last for centuries, are proof against
rain, wind, and fire, and are superior in solidity to any cement. Even
at this day Spain still holds watch-towers that were erected by
Hannibal.</i>”</p>
